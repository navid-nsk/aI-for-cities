The main objective of this research is to estimate the earthquake risk based on probability and hazard in Palu region using cross-correlation among the derived parameters, Silhouette clustering (SC), pure locational clustering (PLC) based on hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), convolutional neural network (CNN) and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) techniques. There is no specific or simple way of identifying risks as the definition of risk varies with time and space. The main aim of this study is: i) to conduct the clustering analysis to identify the earthquake-prone areas, ii) to develop a CNN model for probability estimation, and iii) to estimate and compare the risk using two calculation equations (Risk A and B). Owing to its high prediction ability, the CNN model assessed the probability while SC and PLC were implemented to understand the spatial clustering, Euclidean distance among clusters, spatial relationship and cross-correlation among the estimated Mw, PGA and intensity including events depth. Finally, AHP was implemented for the vulnerability assessment. To this end, earthquake probability assessment (EPA), susceptibility to seismic amplification (SSA) and earthquake vulnerability assessment (EVA) results were employed to generate risk A, while earthquake hazard assessment (EHA), SSA and EVA were used to generate risk B. The risk maps were compared and the differences in results were obtained. This research concludes that in the case of earthquake risk assessment (ERA), results obtained in Risk B are better than the risk A. This study achieved 89.47% accuracy for EPA while for EVA a consistency ratio of 0.07. These results have important implications for future large-scale risk assessment, land use planning and hazard mitigation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Funding text 1: This research is funded by the Centre for Advanced Modelling and Geospatial Information Systems (CAMGIS), Faculty of Engineering and IT, the University of Technology Sydney .

To date, these two processes have not been studied together and compared with transboundary fossil fuel-based CO2 emissions of urban energy use. We leverage remote sensing and machine learning to quantify biogenic CO2 emissions between 2006 and 2012, across 11 U.S cities, including central and suburban cities, in different climate zones. Results indicate that in situ carbon sequestration by greenery varied moderately across cities (-2.1 to -0.87 Mg CO2 ha-1 yr-1), while emissions from the carbon stock change due to land conversion varied much more (-3.4 to 9.8 Mg CO2 ha-1 yr-1), indicating that the latter dominates biogenic CO2 emissions. Net biogenic CO2 emissions were negative (carbon sink) in four cities, while large net positive emissions were present in rapidly growing suburbs. As a ratio of community-wide energy use for travel and buildings, biogenic CO2 emissions were a small proportion in the core cities Denver (0.17%) and Minneapolis (0.33%) and as high as 38.2% in growing exurban communities.

This paper addresses the challenge of using Landsat data, particularly its 30 m spatial resolution, for monitoring three-dimensional urban densification. Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for scene recognition resulting in resolution loss, the proposed semantic segmentation framework provides a pixel-wise classification and improves the accuracy of urban form mapping. We compare temporal and spatial transferability of an adapted DeepLab model with a simple fully convolutional network (FCN) and a texture-based random forest (RF) model to map urban density in the two morphological dimensions: horizontal (compact, open, sparse) and vertical (high rise, low rise). We test whether a model trained on the 2014 data can be applied to 2006 and 1995 for Denmark, and examine whether we could use the model trained on the Danish data to accurately map ten other European cities. Our results show that an implementation of deep networks and the inclusion of multi-scale contextual information greatly improve the classification and the model's ability to generalize across space and time. Between the two semantic segmentation models, DeepLab provides more accurate horizontal and vertical classifications than FCN when sufficient training data is available. By using DeepLab, the F1 score can be increased by 4 and 10 percentage points for detecting vertical urban growth compared to FCN and RF for Denmark. For mapping the ten other European cities with training data from Denmark, DeepLab also shows an advantage of 6 percentage points over RF for both horizontal and vertical dimensions. The resulting maps across the years 1985 to 2018 reveal different patterns of urban growth between Copenhagen and Aarhus, the two largest cities in Denmark, illustrating that those cities have used various planning policies in addressing population growth and housing supply challenges. In summary, we propose a transferable deep learning approach for automated, long-term mapping of urban form from Landsat images that is effective in areas experiencing a slow pace of urban growth or with small-scale changes. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","This study was supported by a Ph.D. scholarship from the Ministry of Education, Taiwan, by BERTHA - the Danish Big Data Centre for Environment and Health funded by the Novo Nordisk Foundation Challenge Programme (grant NNF17OC0027864 ), and by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (Grant Agreement No. ERC-2016-StG-714087 , Acronym: So2Sat).

Design/methodology/approach: The tools of the study are the way of processing by SML, predicting the future based on the past. Machine learning is benefited from Python advantages. The structure of the study consisted of two main parts, as the majority of the similar studies follow: engineering energy modeling and statistical energy modeling. According to the concept of the study, at first, from 2268 models, some are randomly selected, simulated and sensitively analyzed by ENVI-met. Furthermore, the Envi-met output as the quantity of thermal comfort – predicted mean vote (PMV) and weather items are inputs of Python. Then, the formed data set is processed by SML, to reach the final reliable predicted output. Findings: The process of SML leads the study to find thermal comfort of current models and other similar sidewalks. The results are evaluated by both PMV mathematical model and SML error evaluation functions. The results confirm that the average of the occurred error is about 1%. Then the method of study is reliable to apply in the variety of similar fields. Finding of this study can be helpful in perspective of the sustainable architecture strategies in the buildings and urban scales, to determine, monitor and control energy-based behaviors (thermal comfort, heating, cooling, lighting and ventilation) in operational phase of the systems (existed elements in buildings, and constructions) and the planning and designing phase of the future built cases – all over their life spans. Research limitations/implications: Limitations of the study are related to the study variables and alternatives that are notable impact on the findings. Furthermore, the most trustable input data will result in the more accuracy in output. Then modeling and simulation processes are most significant part of the research to reach the exact results in the final step. Practical implications: Finding of the study can be helpful in urban design strategies. By finding outdoor thermal comfort that resulted from machine learning method, urban and landscape designers, policymakers and architects are able to estimate the features of their designs in air quality and urban health and can be sure in catching design goals in case of thermal comfort in urban atmosphere. Social implications: By 2030, cities are delved as living spaces for about three out of five people. As green infrastructures influence in moderating the cities’ climate, the relationship between green spaces and habitants’ thermal comfort is deduced. Although the strategies to outside thermal comfort improvement, by design methods and applicants, are not new subject to discuss, applying machines that may be common in predicting results can be called as a new insight in applying more effective design strategies and in urban environment’s comfort preparation. Then study’s footprint in social implications stems in learning from the previous projects and developing more efficient strategies to prepare cities as the more comfortable and healthy places to live, with the more efficient models and consuming money and time. Originality/value: The study achievements are expected to be applied not only in Tehran but also in other climate zones as the pattern in more eco-city design strategies.

Notably, a large amount of electronic text data indicates great difficulty in finding or extracting relevant information from them. Design/methodology/approach: This study presents an original system to extract Arabic-named entities by combining a deep neural network-based part-of-speech tagger and a neural network-based named entity extractor. Firstly, the system extracts the grammatical classes of the words with high precision depending on the context of the word. This module plays the role of the disambiguation process. Then, a second module is used to extract the named entities. Findings: Using deep neural networks in natural language processing, requires tuning many hyperparameters, which is a time-consuming process. To deal with this problem, applying statistical methods like the Taguchi method is much requested. In this study, the system is successfully applied to the Arabic-named entities recognition, where accuracy of 96.81 per cent was reported, which is better than the state-of-the-art results. Research limitations/implications: The system is designed and trained for the Arabic language, but the architecture can be used for other languages. Practical implications: Information extraction systems are developed for different applications, such as analysing newspaper articles and databases for commercial, political and social objectives. Information extraction systems also can be built over an information retrieval (IR) system. The IR system eliminates irrelevant documents and paragraphs. Originality/value: The proposed system can be regarded as the first attempt to use double deep neural networks to increase the accuracy. It also can be built over an IR system. The IR system eliminates irrelevant documents and paragraphs.

This paper aims to propose a location prediction model utilizing stay point feature extraction. The model firstly constructs the historical trajectory links based on trajectory data, performs the location discovery rules to transform historical trajectory links into stay point links and clusters the stay points to form clustering links. Secondly, the model extracts the feature information (entry time, departure time, weather and land use) from different stay points and extracts the space feature from clustering links. Finally, the cluster links with feature information is introduced into long short-term memory (LSTM) network for customization to implement the personal location prediction capability. By using a 23-day trajectory location data of more than 3 million volunteer users in Shenzhen city, China. The results show that the location prediction F-score of our proposed model is better than variable order Markov model (about 5.5% performance gains) and the traditional N-order Markov model (about 7% performance gains). The model also introduces approximately 6.6% performance gains by utilizing the temporal and weather features of stay points.

Road networks pattern recognition is an intelligent recognition problem that combines road geometric features, semantic features, and contextual relationships. The current road pattern recognition methods are mainly using geometric measures and statistical indicators to detect pattern recognition rules, and based on the edge-node graph structure and the polygon group structure of road network.As the expression of road patterns is influenced by human spatial cognition and visual psychology, rule-based reasoning and statistical analysis are difficult to obtain results consistent with human judgment. Driven by artificial intelligence technology, this paper introduces a novel deep learning model for graph structure, namely graph convolution network (GCN), to identify the grid-pattern in a road network. Firstly, to construct the graph structure, the road intersections are taken as nodes and the roads are taken as edges, all nodes are classified into grid and non-grid to act as the label and prediction target of the model. Road segments are then broken into consecutive linear units to extract the characteristics of the nodes which are also the input of the model. Then, the grid pattern is recognized by extracting the roads whose endpoints are all predicted to be a grid. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the method can reach 89.2% for road network's node classification and 86.1% for road segment classification, so it is effective for identifying grid pattern in a road network. © 2020, Editorial Board of Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University.

However, most services in these areas of smart cities have become data-driven, thus generating big data that require sharing, storing, processing, and analysis, which ultimately consumes massive amounts of energy. The accumulation process of these data from different areas of a smart city is a challenging issue. Therefore, researchers have started aiming at the Internet of vehicles (IoV), in which smart vehicles are equipped with computing and storage capabilities to communicate with surrounding infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a subcategory of IoV as the Internet of buses (IoB), where public buses enable a service as a data carrier in a smart city by introducing a neural network-based sustainable data dissemination system (NESUDA), where opportunistic sensing comprises delay-tolerant data collection, processing and disseminating from one place to another place around the city. The objective was to use public transport to carry data from one place to another and to reduce the traffic from traditional networks and energy consumption. An advanced neural network (NN) algorithm was applied to locate the realistic arrival time of public buses for data allocation. We used the Auckland transport (AT) buses data set from the transport agency to validate our model for the level of accuracy in predicted bus arrival time and scheduled arrival time to disseminate data using bus services. Data were uploaded onto buses as per their dwelling time at each stop and terminals within the coverage area of deployed RSU. The offloading capacity of our proposed data dissemination system showed that it could be utilized to effectively complement traditional data networks. Moreover, the maximum offloading capacity at each parent stop could reach up to 360 GB with a huge saving of energy consumption. © 2020 by the authors.

This study investigates the use of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in order to characterize spatial arrangement features for land use classification from high resolution remote sensing images, with particular interest in comparing land use classifications between different graph-based methods and between different remote sensing images. We examine three kinds of graph-based methods, i.e., feature engineering, graph kernels, and GCNs. Based upon the extracted arrangement features and features regarding the spatial composition of land cover objects, we formulated ten land use classifications. We tested those on two different remote sensing images, which were acquired from GaoFen-2 (with a spatial resolution of 0.8 m) and ZiYuan-3 (of 2.5 m) satellites in 2020 on Fuzhou City, China. Our results showed that land use classifications that are based on the arrangement features derived from GCNs achieved the highest classification accuracy than using graph kernels and handcrafted graph features for both images. We also found that the contribution to separating land use types by arrangement features varies between GaoFen-2 and ZiYuan-3 images, due to the difference in the spatial resolution.

The large availability of sensor data enables the adoption of analytical tools to provide decision support capabilities. Employing sensors facilitates air pollution monitoring, but the lack of predictive capability limits such systems’ potential in practical scenarios. On the other hand, forecasting methods offer the opportunity to predict the future pollution in specific areas, potentially suggesting useful preventive measures. To date, many works tackled the problem of air pollution forecasting, most of which are based on sequence models. These models are trained with raw pollution data and are subsequently utilized to make predictions. This paper proposes a novel approach evaluating four different architectures that utilize camera images to estimate the air pollution in those areas. These images are further enhanced with weather data to boost the classification accuracy. The proposed approach exploits generative adversarial networks combined with data augmentation techniques to mitigate the class imbalance problem. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves robust accuracy of up to 0.88, which is comparable to sequence models and conventional models that utilize air pollution data. This is a remarkable result considering that the historic air pollution data is directly related to the output—future air pollution data, whereas the proposed architecture uses camera images to recognize the air pollution—which is an inherently much more difficult problem. © 2020 by the authors.

Such a dynamic approach is an enabling technology for multi-modal transportation planners, in which the optimal path and its associated transportation solutions are updated in real-time based on data coming from (i) distributed sensors (e.g., smart traffic lights, road congestion sensors, etc.); (ii) service providers (e.g., car-sharing availability, bus waiting time, etc.); and (iii) the user’s own device, in compliance with the development of smart cities envisaged by the 5G architecture. In this paper, we present a series of Machine Learning approaches for real-time Transportation Mode Recognition and we report their performance difference in our field tests. Several Machine Learning-based classifiers, including Deep Neural Networks, built on both statistical feature extraction and raw data analysis are presented and compared in this paper; the result analysis also highlights which features are proven to be the most informative ones for the classification. © 2020 by the authors.

A smart city utilizes IoT-enabled technologies, communications and applications to maximize operational efficiency and enhance both the service providers’ quality of services and people’s wellbeing and quality of life. With the growth of smart city networks, however, comes the increased risk of cybersecurity threats and attacks. IoT devices within a smart city network are connected to sensors linked to large cloud servers and are exposed to malicious attacks and threats. Thus, it is important to devise approaches to prevent such attacks and protect IoT devices from failure. In this paper, we explore an attack and anomaly detection technique based on machine learning algorithms (LR, SVM, DT, RF, ANN and KNN) to defend against and mitigate IoT cybersecurity threats in a smart city. Contrary to existing works that have focused on single classifiers, we also explore ensemble methods such as bagging, boosting and stacking to enhance the performance of the detection system. Additionally, we consider an integration of feature selection, cross-validation and multi-class classification for the discussed domain, which has not been well considered in the existing literature. Experimental results with the recent attack dataset demonstrate that the proposed technique can effectively identify cyberattacks and the stacking ensemble model outperforms comparable models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score, implying the promise of stacking in this domain. © 2020 by the authors.

To realize this, the smart city data sharing system based on DNA (Data, Network, Artificial Intelligence) must be established to collect, store, process, share and use city data. Global countries such as the U.S. and U.K. are continuously expanding infrastructure for realizing data-based smart cities. Keeping pace with this trend, Korean government has selected smart city as a key national initiative since 2018, and has been discovering and carrying out various R&D projects that combine cutting-edge ICT technologies into smart cities to solve urban problems. In particular, as the core technology for realizing a data-driven smart city, we have been developing the smart city data hub based on international standards that can be used in various fields by collecting high-quality data from systems in cities. The smart city data hub has to be verified for the compliance of technologies in order to be successfully applied to demonstration cities. In this paper, the target and scope of test verification were defined through the analysis of the data hub architecture and major functions, and the validation was performed and analyzed based on the developed test specification and equipment.

Accurate forecasting allows grid operators to properly maintain the balance of supply and demand as well as to optimize operational cost for generation and transmission. This article proposes a novel neural network architecture PowerNet which can incorporate multiple heterogeneous features such as historical energy consumption data, weather data and calendar information for the demand forecasting task. Using real-world smart meter dataset, we conduct an extensive evaluation to show the advantages of PowerNet over recently-proposed machine learning methods such as Gradient Boosting Tree (GBT), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). PowerNet demonstrates notable performance in reducing both the median and worst-case prediction errors when forecasting demands of individual residential households. We further provide empirical results concerning the two operational considerations that are crucial when using PowerNet in practice: the time horizon the model can predict with a decent accuracy and the frequency of training the model to retain its modeling capability.

Turning these data into knowledge to facilitate planning efforts in addressing current challenges of urban complex systems requires advanced interdisciplinary analysis methods, such as urban informatics or urban data science. Yet, by applying a purely data-driven approach, it is too easy to get lost in the ‘forest’ of data, and to miss the ‘trees’ of successful, livable cities that are the ultimate aim of urban planning. This paper assesses how geospatial data, and urban analysis, using a mixed methods approach, can help to better understand urban dynamics and human behavior, and how it can assist planning efforts to improve livability. Based on reviewing state-of-the-art research the paper goes one step further and also addresses the potential as well as limitations of new data sources in urban analytics to get a better overview of the whole ‘forest’ of these new data sources and analysis methods. The main discussion revolves around the reliability of using big data from social media platforms or sensors, and how information can be extracted from massive amounts of data through novel analysis methods, such as machine learning, for better-informed decision making aiming at urban livability improvement. © 2020 by the authors.

The existing methods are usually modeled on a user–item-score matrix, which does not consider the transformation of users and items. The transformation is hidden in the behavior and reflected in the shopping sequence. In a smart city of the future, products can be expressed by sensors: for a given item, the changes in its audience can be observed from the sequence of users who have bought these products, and for a given user the changes in his or her need submitted as requirement can be obtained according to the sequence of purchased commodities. To better capture the shopping sequence and apply it to recommendations, we proposed an E-commerce recommendation algorithm similar to the recommendation problem in the smart city using a double-layer graph neural network (DLGNN) to model the user sequence and item sequence and predict the purchasing behavior of users. In the DLGNN, the sequence data, including the sequence of users who have bought a particular item and the sequence of purchased commodities from each user, are first modeled as graph-structure data. Then by using a graph neural network (GNN), one can express the state of each node of the graph as cells in the neural network. On this basis, the pretrained representation vectors of users and commodities are used to represent their global information. The state vectors and representation vectors can be used to model the purchasing behavior of users. Experiments based on a real dataset show that the proposed method yields better performance than existing recommendation algorithms. © 2020 M Y U Scientific Publishing Division.

The search was based on the keywords of “artificial intelligence” (or “AI”), and “robot,” representing robotics and associated terminology. Based on the findings, it is evident that the more concentrated deployment of AI and robotics in smart city development is currently in the Global North, although countries in the Global South are also increasingly represented.

We argue that such an approach to solution development makes the outcome of solutions less explainable, i.e., it is often not possible to explain the results of the model. There is a growing concern among policymakers in cities with this lack of explainability of AI solutions, and this is considered a major hindrance in the wider acceptability and trust in such AI-based solutions. In this work, we survey the concept of ‘explainable deep learning’ as a subset of the ‘explainable AI’ problem and propose a new solution using Semantic Web technologies, demonstrated with a smart cities flood monitoring application in the context of a European Commission-funded project. Monitoring of gullies and drainage in crucial geographical areas susceptible to flooding issues is an important aspect of any flood monitoring solution. Typical solutions for this problem involve the use of cameras to capture images showing the affected areas in real-time with different objects such as leaves, plastic bottles etc., and building a DL-based classifier to detect such objects and classify blockages based on the presence and coverage of these objects in the images. In this work, we uniquely propose an Explainable AI solution using DL and Semantic Web technologies to build a hybrid classifier. In this hybrid classifier, the DL component detects object presence and coverage level and semantic rules designed with close consultation with experts carry out the classification. By using the expert knowledge in the flooding context, our hybrid classifier provides the flexibility on categorising the image using objects and their coverage relationships. The experimental results demonstrated with a real-world use case showed that this hybrid approach of image classification has on average 11% improvement (F-Measure) in image classification performance compared to DL-only classifier. It also has the distinct advantage of integrating experts’ knowledge on defining the decision-making rules to represent the complex circumstances and using such knowledge to explain the results. © 2020 by the authors.

It is necessary to obtain the rapid and accurate inversion of cultivated land fertility via remote sensing for the better utilization and management of land resource. In this study, a new inversion model was constructed and optimized using the classical statistical analysis (SLR, CR, and MLSR), and machine learning (BPNN and ELM). An effective way was also proposed for rapid quantitative remote sensing inversion of cultivated land fertility in hilly areas. Dongping County and Tengzhou City were selected as two representative counties and cities in the hilly area of center southern Shandong Province, China. In Dongping County, the TM image during the turning green and jointing stage was used to construct and screen spectral indexes of cultivated land fertility. Tengzhou City was selected to verify the spatial universality of inversion model for the soil fertility of a cultivated land. Furthermore, the remote sensing inversion model was used to quantitatively monitor the spatial-temporal dynamic status of cultivated land fertility in Tengzhou City in 2007, 2011, and 2016. The prediction accuracy of inversion models was compared in different periods. The results showed that there were significant correlations between the five kinds of spectral indexes in a remote sensing and the Integrated Fertility Index (IFI), among which the correlation coefficients of improved spectral index were greater than 0.684, indicating better reflecting the status of cultivated land fertility. The best inversion model was the IIG-MLSR model (R<inf>v</inf>2=0.684, RMSE=5.674) in the classical statistical analysis, while, the IIG-BPNN model (R<inf>v</inf>2=0.746, RMSE=5.089) in the machine learning. The obtained model demonstrated excellent universal applicability in hilly areas, where there were similar spatial distribution characteristics between the inversion and evaluation on the cultivated land fertility, and the similar proportion of cultivated land and high spatial compatibility. In the two best models, the difference in the area ratio of the high, middle, and low levels of cultivated land fertility inversion and cultivated land fertility evaluation was generally less than 5.55 percentage point, where the spatial fit was 84.50% and 88.76%, respectively. The dynamic inversion analysis showed that the cultivated land fertility of Tengzhou City increased continuously in recent 10 years (from 2007 to 2016). The area proportion of high-level land increased from 67.30% to 80.72%, whereas, that of middle-level and low-level land decreased. The multi-temporal remote sensing inversion of cultivated land fertility was feasible, compared with the remote sensing inversion models in different time periods. The optimal time phase to invert the cultivated land fertility was the turning green and jointing stage of winter wheat in April, followed by bare soil in October, and the worst in summer maize in August. The remote sensing inversion index and model can be used to effectively increase the evaluation efficiency of cultivated land fertility. At the same time, this finding can provide a positive reference for the related research of cultivated land quality. © 2020, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Optimization of elevator control strategies can be easily done using the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. This study presents a novel method for optimal dispatching of conventional passenger elevators using the information obtained by surveillance cameras. It is assumed that a real-time video is processed by an image processing system that determines the number of passengers and items waiting for an elevator car in hallways and riding the lifts. It is supposed that these numbers are also associated with a given uncertainly probability. The efficiency of our novel elevator control algorithm is achieved not only by the probabilistic utilization of the number of people and/or items waiting but also from the demand to exhaustively serve a crowded floor, directing to it as many elevators as there are available and filling them up to the maximum allowed weight. The proposed algorithm takes into account the uncertainty that can take place due to inaccuracy of the image processing system, introducing the concept of effective number of people and items using Bayesian networks. The aim is to reduce the waiting time. According to the simulation results, the implementation of the proposed algorithm resulted in reduction of the passenger journey time. The proposed approach was tested on a 10-storey office building with five elevator cars and traffic size and intensity varying from 10 to 300 and 0.01 to 3, respectively. The results showed that, for the interfloor traffic conditions, the average travel time for scenarios with varying traffic size and intensity improved by 39.94% and 19.53%, respectively. © 2020 by the authors.

Most solutions are based on counting, speed detection, traffic accidents and vehicle classification. The mentioned solutions are mostly based on high-quality videos, wide angles camera view, vehicles in motion, and are optimized for good visibility conditions intervals. A novelty of the proposed algorithm and solution is more accurate digital data extraction from video file sources generated by security cameras in Bosnia and Herzegovina from M18 roadway, but not limited only to that particular source. From the video file sources, data regarding number of vehicles, speed, traveling direction, and time intervals for the region of interest will be collected. Since finding contours approach is effective only on objects that are mobile, and because the application of this approach on traffic junctions did not yield desired results, a more specific approach of classification using a combination of Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Support Vector Machines (Linear SVM) has shown to be more appropriate as the original source data can be used for training where the main benefit is the preservation of local second-order interactions, providing tolerance to local geometric misalignment and ability to work with small data samples. The features of the objects within a frame are extracted first by standardizing the feature variables and then computing the first order gradients of the frame. In the next stage, an encoding that remains robust to small changes while being sensitive to local frame content is produced. Finally, the HOG descriptors are generated and normalized again. In this way the channel histogram and spatial vector becomes the feature vector for the Linear SVM classifier. With the following parameters and setup system accuracy was around 85 to 95%.

The relevance and prospects of using this class of aircraft as part of flying ad-hoc networks (FANET) for transmitting high-speed information in ""smart cities"" are shown. The problem of these networks is also noted, due to uncertain reliability and quality of wireless communication, associated with multipath propagation of signals and a number of other factors. It is shown that the development of mathematical modeling methods for analyzing signals at the inputs of UAV radio receivers for evaluating their amplitude-phase transformations by a communication channel is particularly relevant. It is established that the relationship between the signals on the transmitting and receiving sides of an arbitrary wireless radio channel, assuming its linearity, can be uniquely determined by a complex transfer function in the frequency domain, which in practice is very complex and difficult to describe analytically. In this regard, an approach to its approximation by an equivalent model described by fractional-rational functions of a complex variable that are physically realized by connection of various linear inertial and non-inertial links is proposed, and for modeling dynamic characteristics, a method of numerical and analytical modeling based on the spectral method and piecewise linear approximation is proposed. © International Research Publication House.","The work was supported by RFBR grant 19-29-06030-MK ""Research and development of wireless ad-hoc network technology between UAVs and control centers of ""smart city"" on the basis of adaptation of transmission mode parameters at different levels of network interaction"".

Although many of these areas closely relate to the urban context, there is limited understanding of the trending AI technologies and their application areas—or concepts—in the urban planning and development fields. Similarly, there is a knowledge gap in how the public perceives AI technologies, their application areas, and the AI-related policies and practices of our cities. This study aims to advance our understanding of the relationship between the key AI technologies (n = 15) and their key application areas (n = 16) in urban planning and development. To this end, this study examines public perceptions of how AI technologies and their application areas in urban planning and development are perceived and utilized in the testbed case study of Australian states and territories.

Due to the accelerating effects of climate change along with such urbanization, it is imperative for urban rivers to establish a flood warning system that can predict the amount of high flow rates of accuracy in engineering, compared to using the existing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models for disaster prevention. In this study, in the case of streams where missing data existed or only small observations were obtained, the variation in flow rates could be predicted with only the appropriate deep learning models, using only limited time series flow data. In addition, the selected deep learning model allowed the minimum number of input learning data to be determined. In this study, the time series flow rates were predicted by applying the deep learning models to the Han River, which is a highly urbanized stream that flows through the capital of Korea, Seoul and has a large seasonal variation in the flow rate. The deep learning models used are Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Sequence lengths for time series runoff data were determined first to assess the accuracy and applicability of the deep learning models. By analyzing the forecast results of the outflow data of the Han River, sequence length for 14 days was appropriate in terms of the predicted accuracy of the model. In addition, the GRU model is effective for deep learning models that use time series data of the region with large fluctuations in flow rates, such as the Han River. Furthermore, through this study, it was possible to propose the minimum number of training data that could provide flood warning system with an effective flood forecasting system although the number of input data such as flow rates secured in new towns developed around rivers was insufficient. © 2020 by the authors.

Due to the significant uncertainties and dynamic variables, modeling real estate has been studied as complex systems. In this study, a novel machine learning method is proposed to tackle real estate modeling complexity. Call detail records (CDR) provides excellent opportunities for in-depth investigation of the mobility characterization. This study explores the CDR potential for predicting the real estate price with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI). Several essential mobility entropy factors, including dweller entropy, dweller gyration, workers’ entropy, worker gyration, dwellers’ work distance, and workers’ home distance, are used as input variables. The prediction model is developed using the machine learning method of multi-layered perceptron (MLP) trained with the evolutionary algorithm of particle swarm optimization (PSO). Model performance is evaluated using mean square error (MSE), sustainability index (SI), and Willmott’s index (WI). The proposed model showed promising results revealing that the workers’ entropy and the dwellers’ work distances directly influence the real estate price. However, the dweller gyration, dweller entropy, workers’ gyration, and the workers’ home had a minimum effect on the price. Furthermore, it is shown that the flow of activities and entropy of mobility are often associated with the regions with lower real estate prices. © 2020 by the authors.

For some cities and regions, these data exist in detailed 3D models based on real-world measurements. However, they are still expensive to build and maintain, a significant challenge, especially for small and medium-sized cities that are home to the majority of the European population. New methods are needed to estimate relevant building stock characteristics reliably and cost-effectively. Here, we present a machine learning based method for predicting building heights, which is based only on open-access geospatial data on urban form, such as building footprints and street networks. The method allows to predict building heights for regions where no dedicated 3D models exist currently. We train our model using building data from four European countries (France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany) and find that the morphology of the urban fabric surrounding a given building is highly predictive of the height of the building. A test on the German state of Brandenburg shows that our model predicts building heights with an average error well below the typical floor height (about 2.5 m), without having access to training data from Germany. Furthermore, we show that even a small amount of local height data obtained by citizens substantially improves the prediction accuracy. Our results illustrate the possibility of predicting missing data on urban infrastructure; they also underline the value of open government data and volunteered geographic information for scientific applications, such as contextual but scalable strategies to mitigate climate change. © 2020 Milojevic-Dupont et al.

As a result, smart healthcare applications have been and are being developed to provide, using mobile and electronic technology, higher diagnosis quality of the diseases, better treatment of the patients, and improved quality of lives. Since smart healthcare applications that are mainly concerned with the prediction of healthcare data (like diseases for example) rely on predictive healthcare data analytics, it is imperative for such predictive healthcare data analytics to be as accurate as possible. In this paper, we will exploit supervised machine learning methods in classification and regression to improve the performance of the traditional Random Forest on healthcare datasets, both in terms of accuracy and classification/regression speed, in order to produce an effective and efficient smart healthcare application, which we have termed eGAP. eGAP uses the evolutionary game theoretic approach replicator dynamics to evolve a Random Forest ensemble. Trees of high resemblance in an initial Random Forest are clustered, and then clusters grow and shrink by adding and removing trees using replicator dynamics, according to the predictive accuracy of each subforest represented by a cluster of trees. All clusters have an initial number of trees that is equal to the number of trees in the smallest cluster. Cluster growth is performed using trees that are not initially sampled. The speed and accuracy of the proposed method have been demonstrated by an experimental study on 10 classification and 10 regression medical datasets. © 2020 by the authors.

This study presents an advanced Artificial Intelligence-based (AI) signal control framework, able to incorporate environmental considerations into the core of signal optimisation processes. More specifically, a highly flexible Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm has been developed towards the identification of efficient but-more importantly-environmentally friendly signal control strategies. The methodology is deployed on a large-scale micro-simulation environment able to realistically represent urban traffic conditions. Alternative signal control strategies are designed, applied, and evaluated against their achieved traffic efficiency and environmental footprint. Based on the results obtained from the application of the methodology on a core part of the road urban network of Nicosia, Cyprus the best strategy achieved a 4.8% increase of the network throughput, 17.7% decrease of the average queue length and a remarkable 34.2% decrease of delay while considerably reduced the CO emissions by 8.1%. The encouraging results showcase ability of RL-based traffic signal controlling to ensure improved air-quality conditions for the residents of dense urban areas. © 2020 Haris Ballis et al., published by Sciendo.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097383929,Yes,Cyprus,Transportation,Traffic Management,Urban Mobility & Transportation,Reinforcement Learning,Optimization,Develop AI-based signal control for improved traffic efficiency and reduced emissions,"SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 13 (Climate)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

Many scientists and engineers around the world have focused on establishing increasingly robust and accurate algorithms and methods for these types of systems and their applications in everyday life. FR is developing technology with multiple real-time applications. The goal of this paper is to develop a complete FR system using transfer learning in fog computing and cloud computing. The developed system uses deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) because of the dominant representation; there are some conditions including occlusions, expressions, illuminations, and pose, which can affect the deep FR performance. DCNN is used to extract relevant facial features. These features allow us to compare faces between them in an efficient way. The system can be trained to recognize a set of people and to learn via an online method, by integrating the new people it processes and improving its predictions on the ones it already has. The proposed recognition method was tested with different three standard machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree (DT), K Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM)). The proposed system has been evaluated using three datasets of face images (SDUMLA-HMT, 113, and CASIA) via performance metrics of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and time. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superiority over other algorithms according to all parameters. The suggested algorithm results in higher accuracy (99.06%), higher precision (99.12%), higher recall (99.07%), and higher specificity (99.10%) than the comparison algorithms. © 2020 Salama AbdELminaam et al.

To better manage this risk, especially for open-pit mine (OM) operations, new earth observation tools are required for more accurate baseline mapping and subsequent monitoring. The purpose of this paper is to propose an object-oriented open-pit mine mapping (OOMM) framework from Gaofen-2 (GF-2) high-spatial resolution satellite image (HSRSI), based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To better present the different land use categories (LUCs) in the OM area, a minimum heterogeneity criterion-based multi-scale segmentation method was used, while a mean area ratio method was applied to optimize the segmentation scale of each LUC. After image segmentation, three object-feature domains were obtained based on the GF-2 HSRSI: spectral, texture, and geometric features. Then, the gradient boosting decision tree and Pearson correlation coefficient were used as an object feature information reduction (FIR) method to recognize the distinguishing feature that describe open-pit mines (OMs). Finally, the CNN was used by combing the significant features to map the OM. In total, 105 OM sites were extracted from the interpretation of GF-2 HSRSIs and the boundary of each OM was validated by field work and used as inputs to evaluate the open-pit mine mapping (OMM) accuracy. The results revealed that: (1) the FIR tool made a positive impact on effective OMM; (2) by splitting the segmented objects into two groups, training and testing sets which are composed of 70% of the objects, and validation sets which are formed by the remaining 30% of the objects, then combing the selected feature subsets for training to achieve an overall accuracy (OA) of 90.13% and a Kappa coefficient (KC) of 0.88 of the whole datasets; (3) comparing the results of the state-of-the-art method, support vector machine (SVM), in OMM, the proposed framework outperformed SVM by more than 7.28% in OA, 8.64% in KC, 6.15% in producer accuracy of OM and by 9.31% in user accuracy of OM. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that OM information has been used through the integration of multiscale segmentation of HSRSI with the CNN to get OMM results. The proposed framework can not only provide reliable technical support for the scientific management and environmental monitoring of open pit mining areas, but also be of wide generality and be applicable to other kinds of land use mapping in mining areas using HSR images. © 2020 by the authors.

These sensing devices generate various kinds of tasks, which need to be sent to cloud to process. Usually, the sensing devices do not equip with wireless modules, because it is neither economical nor energy saving. Thus, it is a challenging problem to find a way to offload tasks for sensing devices. However, many vehicles are moving around the city, which can communicate with sensing devices in an effective and low-cost way. In this paper, we propose a computation offloading scheme through mobile vehicles in IoT-edge-cloud network. The sensing devices generate tasks and transmit the tasks to vehicles, then the vehicles decide to compute the tasks in the local vehicle, MEC server or cloud center. The computation offloading decision is made based on the utility function of the energy consumption and transmission delay, and the deep reinforcement learning technique is adopted to make decisions. Our proposed method can make full use of the existing infrastructures to implement the task offloading of sensing devices, the experimental results show that our proposed solution can achieve the maximum reward and decrease delay. © 2020, The Author(s).","Funding text 1: National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant (61472450, 61772554), the Key Technology Research and Development Program of Hunan Province under Grant 2018GK2052.; Funding text 2: This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61772554, in part by the Key Technology Research and Development Program of Hunan Province under Grant 2018GK2052.; Funding text 3: This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61772554, in part by the Key Technology Research and Development Program of Hunan Province under Grant 2018GK2052.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096984464,Yes,China,Infrastructure,Edge Computing,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Reinforcement Learning,Optimization,Develop deep RL-based task offloading through mobile vehicles in IoT-edge-cloud network,"SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 9 (Infrastructure)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

Analysis on cellular datasets covering 2.4 million users in China reveals dependencies and distinctive patterns of crowd flows in not only the conventional space and time domains, but also the speed domain, due to the diverse transportation modes in the mobility data. DeepFlowFlex explicitly groups crowd flows with respect to speed and time, and combines graph convolutional long short-term memory networks and graph convolutional neural networks to extract complex spatiotemporal dependencies, especially long-term and long-distance inter-region dependencies.

Their market share has grown exponentially due to the convenience they provide. The use of such services may be associated with car-light or car-free lifestyles. However, there are growing concerns regarding their impact on urban transportation operations performance due to empty, unproductive miles driven without a passenger (commonly referred to as deadheading). This paper is motivated by the potential to reduce deadhead mileage of ridesourcing trips by providing drivers with information on future ridesourcing trip demand. Future demand information enables the driver to wait in place for the next rider's request without cruising around and contributing to congestion. A machine learning model is employed to predict hourly and 10-minute future interval travel demand for ridesourcing at a given location. Using future demand information, we propose algorithms to (i) assign drivers to act on received demand information by waiting in place for the next rider, and (ii) match these drivers with riders to minimize deadheading distance. Real-world data from ridesourcing providers in Austin, TX (RideAustin) and Chengdu, China (DiDi Chuxing) are leveraged. Results show that this process achieves 68%–82% and 53%–60% reduction of trip-level deadheading miles for the RideAustin and DiDi Chuxing sample operations respectively, under the assumption of unconstrained availability of short-term parking. Deadheading savings increase slightly as the maximum tolerable waiting time for the driver increases. Further, it is observed that significant deadhead savings per trip are possible, even when a small percent of the ridesourcing driver pool is provided with future ridesourcing demand information. © 2020","This study used open data from the following sources: RideAustin and DiDi Chuxing through the GAIA Initiative.

This technological development, however, manifests in the form of new vulnerabilities and a plethora of attack vectors. In the same context, the ambiguity of ever-evolving cyber threats and their debilitating consequences introduce new barriers for decision-makers. Therefore, cyber situational awareness of smart cities emerges as a mission-critical task that requires support methods for effective and timely decision-making.

Nevertheless, current greenway suitability analysis mainly focuses on geographical and natural issues, failing to account for human-scale urban design factors. Accordingly, this study proposes a data-informed approach to planning urban greenway networks using a combination of classical urban design theories, multi-sourced urban data, and machine learning algorithms. Maoming City in China was used as a case study. Per classical urban design theories, specifically, Cervero and Ewing's 5D variables, density, diversity, design, dimensions of destination accessibility, and distance-to-transit, were selected as key factors. A series of new urban data, including points of interest (PoIs), location-based service (LBS) positioning data, and street view images, were applied in conjunction with machine learning algorithms and geographical information system (GIS) tools to measure these key factors at a human-scale resolution and generate an optimized greenway suitability analysis. This analytical approach is an attempt to take human-scale concerns into account on a city-wide scale regarding greenway network generation. It also pushes the methodological boundaries of greenway planning by combining classical urban design thinking with new urban data and new techniques. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH","We would like to express our appreciation for the editor and three anonymous reviewers for the time and effort you have taken to provide such insightful guidance.

Compared with CAD, GIS tend to offer more flexibility in terms of managing, updating, analyzing, and processing data. Nonetheless, the conversion process to GIS can be extremely challenging from a technical point of view. Moreover, the original data in a legacy format often contain errors, and pieces of infrastructure are often missing. What is more, even once the conversion process is complete, the maintenance of the data and the fusion of the data set with other data sets can be challenging. Leveraging recent technological advances (such as machine learning and semantic reasoning), this paper proposes a framework to better manage infrastructure data. More specifically, a smart data-management protocol is presented to successfully convert infrastructure maps from CAD to GIS that includes a data-cleaning procedure in CAD and machine-learning algorithmic solutions to validate or suggest edits of the infrastructure once converted to GIS. In addition, the protocol includes elements of version control to keep track of how urban infrastructure evolves over time as well as a procedure to combine GIS infrastructure maps with other data sets (such as sociodemographic data) that can be used for optimal scheduling of asset maintenance and repair. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","The authors thank the following students for the preliminary work related to this framework: Omar Belingheri, Guillemette Fonteix, Nalin Naranjo, and Eric Boria.

The futuristic sustainable computing solutions in e-healthcare applications are based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing platform, has offered numerous features and real time services. Several studies revealed that the amount of energy spent on transmitting data from IoT devices to a cloud server is considerably high and resulted in rapid energy depletion. In this view, this paper presents an Energy Efficient Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based Clustering (EEPSOC) technique for the effective selection of cluster heads (CHs) among diverse IoT devices. The IoT devices used for sensing healthcare data are grouped into a form of clusters and a CH will be elected by the use of EEPSOC. The elected CH will forward the data to the cloud server. Then, the CH is responsible for transmitting data of the IoT devices to the cloud server through fog devices. Next to that, an artificial neural network (ANN) based classification model is applied to diagnose the healthcare data in the cloud server to identify the severity of the diseases.

Quantifying the accurate impacts of such natural hazards, however, is a complicated task. The present study uses a deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) algorithm, which is among the newer and most powerful algorithms in big data sets, to develop a flood susceptibility map for Iran. A total of 2769 records were collected from flood locations across the entire country; we divided this data set into two groups using a cross-validation technique. The first group, used as a training data set, was constructed from 70% of the data set and was used for model building. The second group, used as a testing data set, was constructed from the remaining 30% of the records and used for validation. Ten flood conditioning factors, slope, altitude, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, rainfall, geology, land use, distance from roads, and distance from rivers, were identified and used in the modeling process. The area under the prediction-rate curve was used for model evaluation, with results showing that the flood susceptibility map has an acceptable accuracy of 75%. The results also indicated that approximately 12% and 3% of the country are highly and very highly susceptible to future flooding events, respectively. Moreover, 29% and 49% of Iran's cities are located in areas with high and very high susceptibility to future flooding hazards. The most effective approaches to flood mitigation are preventing urban expansion and new construction in highly to very highly flood-prone areas as well as watershed management plans and constructing flood control structures according to the topographical characteristics of the catchment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","This research was supported by the Basic Research Project of the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources (KIGAM) and Project of Environmental Business Big Data Platform and Center Construction funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT.

Climate change, causing sporadic and uneven rains in the largely agricultural state has increased the strain on the already dwindling water table. Hence, there is a need for an in-depth analysis into the current state of these resources for their sustainable utilization. This study deploys 21 factors for predicting the groundwater potential of the region. An inventory of 126 wells was utilized to construct the dataset with the influencing factors. The statistical method of Frequency ratio (FR) and a machine learning (ML) approach of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees with Greedy feature selection (GA-GBDT) have been applied. GA-GBDT model (accuracy: 81%) outperformed the FR model (accuracy: 63%) and it was deduced that ML has the capability to perform equally well and even better than the traditional statistical approaches in similar studies. The models were utilized to generate groundwater potential maps for the region. The FR model predicted 78 sq.km as having a very high potential to yield groundwater, while GA-GBDT estimated it to be 152 sq.km.

There is an exponential demand for efficient, secure, reliable, and uninterrupted electricity supply, so there is a need for an intelligent grid, which uses Information and Communications Technology (ICT) to optimize the generation, circulation, and ingestion of electricity. Thus, Smart Grid (SG) acts as an intelligent grid, which plays an important role in the overall growth of any smart city. Further, the Big Data (BD) generated from SG, provides noteworthy information that could significantly benefit different applications of SG, such as demand response and load profiling. However, an insecure technique for decision-making may lead to the breach of SG data where hackers gained full access to consumer data. On the contrary, a secure technique for decision-making can provide satisfaction to all the stakeholders, including consumers and utility providers. Motivated from these facts, this paper presents a comprehensive literature survey and analysis of state-of-the-art proposals for Secure Data Analytics (SDA) in the SG system. However, to achieve SDA for the SG systems is one of the critical tasks. The existing research and development endeavors not fully exploited the SDA in the SG system. In this paper, we discuss the distinctive nature of SDA and its complexity over the SG data.

We selected three major French cities (Paris, Lyon, and Marseille) to investigate the relationship between the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) outbreak and air pollution. Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) experiments, we have determined the concentration of PM<inf>2.5</inf> and PM<inf>10</inf> linked to COVID-19-related deaths. Our focus is on the potential effects of Particulate Matter (PM) in spreading the epidemic. The underlying hypothesis is that a pre-determined particulate concentration can foster COVID-19 and make the respiratory system more susceptible to this infection. The empirical strategy used an innovative Machine Learning (ML) methodology. In particular, through the so-called cutting technique in ANNs, we found new threshold levels of PM<inf>2.5</inf> and PM<inf>10</inf> connected to COVID-19: 17.4 µg/m3 (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) and 29.6 µg/m3 (PM<inf>10</inf>) for Paris; 15.6 µg/m3 (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) and 20.6 µg/m3 (PM<inf>10</inf>) for Lyon; 14.3 µg/m3 (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) and 22.04 µg/m3 (PM<inf>10</inf>) for Marseille. Interestingly, all the threshold values identified by the ANNs are higher than the limits imposed by the European Parliament.

In these metropolises, criminal activity is much higher and violent than in either small cities or rural areas. Thus, understanding what factors influence urban crime in big cities is a pressing need. Seminal studies analyse crime records through historical panel data or analysis of historical patterns combined with ecological factor and exploratory mapping. More recently, machine learning methods have provided informed crime prediction over time. However, previous studies have focused on a single city at a time, considering only a limited number of factors (such as socio-economical characteristics) and often at large in a single city. Hence, our understanding of the factors influencing crime across cultures and cities is very limited. Here we propose a Bayesian model to explore how violent and property crimes are related not only to socio-economic factors but also to the built environmental (e.g. land use) and mobility characteristics of neighbourhoods. To that end, we analyse crime at small areas and integrate multiple open data sources with mobile phone traces to compare how the different factors correlate with crime in diverse cities, namely Boston, Bogotá, Los Angeles and Chicago. We find that the combined use of socio-economic conditions, mobility information and physical characteristics of the neighbourhood effectively explain the emergence of crime, and improve the performance of the traditional approaches. However, we show that the socio-ecological factors of neighbourhoods relate to crime very differently from one city to another.

The study used SWAT and ANN models to simulate rainfall-runoff. The reasons for selecting these two models are A) SWAT is a physical and complex model that needs precipitation, temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, sundial, soil map, land use map and DEM to simulate, B) ANN model is a simple linear model that needs precipitation, runoff and temperature data. Moreover, SWAT model needs more time and cost than ANN model. In general, the purpose of the study is to evaluate the performance of two models with different structure in urban watershed. The results of this research showed that the performance of the artificial neural network is appropriate for predicting the maximum and minimum runoff values (R2 = 0.75, NSE = 0.74), while the inputs of the model is appropriate and in areas where information is scarce is very appropriate, while the performance of the SWAT model is also appropriate and has very good performance (R2 = 0.66, NSE = 0.65) in managerial and planning and economics studies, especially when there is no statistical station in the upper watershed.

In such systems, autonomous agents interact locally with their users, and remotely with other agents to make intelligent collective choices. Via these interactions they self-regulate the consumption and production of distributed (common) resources, e.g., self-management of traffic flows and power demand in Smart Cities. While such complex systems are often deployed and operated using centralized computing infrastructures, the socio-technical nature of these decentralized systems requires new value-sensitive design paradigms; empowering trust, transparency, and alignment with citizens’ social values, such as privacy preservation, autonomy, and fairness among citizens’ choices. Currently, instruments and tools to study such systems and guide the prototyping process from simulation, to live deployment, and ultimately to a robust operation of a high Technology Readiness Level (TRL) are missing, or not practical in this distributed socio-technical context. This paper bridges this gap by introducing a novel testbed architecture for decentralized socio-technical systems running on IoT. This new architecture is designed for a seamless reusability of (i) application-independent decentralized services by an IoT application, and (ii) different IoT applications by the same decentralized service. This dual self-integration promises IoT applications that are simpler to prototype, and can interoperate with decentralized services during runtime to self-integrate more complex functionality, e.g., data analytics, distributed artificial intelligence. Additionally, such integration provides stronger validation of IoT applications, and improves resource utilization, as computational resources are shared, thus cutting down deployment and operational costs. Pressure and crash tests during continuous operations of several weeks, with more than 80K network joining and leaving of agents, 2.4M parameter changes, and 100M communicated messages, confirm the robustness and practicality of the testbed architecture. This work promises new pathways for managing the prototyping and deployment complexity of decentralized socio-technical systems running on IoT, whose complexity has so far hindered the adoption of value-sensitive self-management approaches in Smart Cities. © 2020 The Authors","This work was supported by the ERC Advanced Grant (324247) Momentum, and the Engineering Social Technologies for a Responsible Digital Future Project at ETH Zurich and TU Delft.

It should be noticed that recent droughts caused by climate change, and on the other hand, population growth has increased the rate of urbanization in Iran, where people are moving from rural areas to urban areas. In this study, two well-known machine learning classifiers, including Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Complex Tree (CTree), are used for land cover mapping. An advanced supervised algorithm, namely the Derivative-free Multi-layer Perceptron (FDMLP), which is based on the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) function, is developed in MATLAB programming language. The FDMLP uses a derivative-free function for the optimization of the MLP function parameters. Three different scenarios using Landsat-8 imagery with spatial resolutions of 30 and 15 m are defined to investigate the effects of data pre-processing on the final predicted Land Use Land Cover (LULC) maps. A Deep Neural Network (DNN) is used for LULC mapping as well. The FDMLP classifier has outperformed the other two well-known algorithms of the SVM and the CTree for the classification of the pixel-based Landsat-8 imagery and the object-based Landsat-8 imagery with a spatial resolution of 15 m in terms of the overall accuracy and index of kappa. Based on the test data, the DNN classifier for the object-based Landsat-8 imagery with a spatial resolution of 15 m with values of 91.28 and 88.57 percent for the OA and Kappa index has outperformed the other supervised classifiers.

Therefore, cities need a more intelligent ""brain"" to form more intelligent and efficient transportation systems. At present, as a type of machine learning, the traditional clustering algorithm still has limitations. K-means algorithm is widely used to solve traffic clustering problems, but it has limitations, such as sensitivity to initial points and poor robustness. Therefore, based on the hybrid architecture of Quantum Annealing (QA) and brain-inspired cognitive computing, this study proposes QA and Brain-Inspired Clustering Algorithm (QABICA) to solve the problem of urban taxi-stand locations. Based on the traffic trajectory data of Xi'an and Chengdu provided by Didi Chuxing, the clustering results of our algorithm and K-means algorithm are compared. We find that the average taxi-stand location bias of the final result based on QABICA is smaller than that based on K-means, and the bias of our algorithm can effectively reduce the tradition K-means bias by approximately 42%, up to approximately 83%, with higher robustness. QA algorithm is able to jump out of the local suboptimal solutions and approach the global optimum, and brain-inspired cognitive computing provides search feedback and direction. Thus, we will further consider applying our algorithm to analyze urban traffic flow, and solve traffic congestion and other key problems in intelligent transportation. © 2020 Tsinghua University Press.

To understand the magnitude and characteristics of UHI in Seoul and to accommodate for the high temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity of the UHI which make it inherently challenging to analyze using conventional statistical methods, we developed two deep learning models, a temporal UHI-model and a spatial UHI model, using a feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) architecture. Data related to meteorological elements (e.g. air temperature) and urban texture (e.g. surface albedo) were used to train and test the temporal UHI-model and the Spatial UHI-model respectively. Also, we develop and propose a new metric, UHI-hours, that quantifies the total number of hours that UHI exists in a given area. Our results show that UHI-hours is a better indicator of seasonal UHI than the commonly used index, UHI-intensity. Consequently, UHI-hours is likely to provide a better measure of the cumulative effects of UHI over time than UHI-intensity. UHI-hours will help us to better quantify the effect of UHI on, for example, the overall daily productivity of outdoor workers or heat-related mortality rates. © 2020, The Author(s).",This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science ICT and Future Planning (NRF-2017R1D1A1A09000639).

According to the diver operational productivity, preserving public safety government law enforcement integrated that face recognition is more important in smart cities. Traditional face recognition system fails to predict the exact facial features that leads to reduce the facial recognition accuracy. The false facial point detection process maximizes the computation complexity. Therefore, in this work, effective and artificial intelligence internet of things–based facial expression detection system is implemented to predict and match the face from the database. Initially, the facial images are captured from the internet of things sensor device, which is processed by applying the Perona-Malik diffusion algorithm. Then, face location is cropped from the image, geometric face shape model is created for predicting the exact face from the template face image. From the face shape, different facial features are extracted from various region using Fisher linear discriminant analysis. The derived features are trained with the help of convolution network and the face recognition process is done by using the adaboost large memory storage and retrieval neural network.

A coupled approach integrating satellite data products of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) change along with chemical evaluation of As toxicity were modelled to evaluate the groundwater vulnerability. Change detection analysis was incorporated using the satellite images of 2013 and 2016 which shows 10 % increase in the buildings as compared to the total area of the study in given period. The LULC class that has been most compromised in this expansion and got reduced were the vegetation (∼6 %) and the barren areas (∼4 %) and the total surface water sources (0.5 %), all contributing in increased urban sprawl. As per the origin of As contamination in the area it seems that high sediment deposition along the braided Brahmaputra River stretch leads to As contamination which was associated with Fe-(oxy)-hydroxide dissolution. The vulnerability assessment using Artificial Neural Network technique in this region shows that As is present relatively in lesser concentration in the east direction. The continuous expansion of the urban habitation towards the greater As concentration zone will further make the situation critical for the people dependent on groundwater.

The LCS features integrate machine learning based calibration models and virtual sensors. LCS performances are analyzed and some LCS variables with low performance are improved through intelligent field-calibrations. Meteorological variables are calibrated using linear dynamic models.While, due to the non-linear relationship to reference instruments, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) are calibrated using non-linear machine learning models. However, due to sensor drifts or faults, carbon dioxide (CO2) does not present correlation to reference instrument. As a result, the LCS for CO2 is not feasible to be calibrated. Hence, to estimate the CO2 concentration,mathematicalmodels are developed to be integrated in the calibrated LCS, known as a virtual sensor. In addition, another virtual sensor is developed to demonstrate the capability of estimating air pollutant concentrations, e.g. black carbon, when the physical sensor devices are not available. In our paper, calibration models and virtual sensors are established using corresponding reference instruments that are installed on two reference stations. This strategy generalizes the models of calibration and virtual sensing which then allows LCS to be deployed in field independently with a high accuracy. Our proposed methodology enables scaling-up accurate air pollution mapping appropriate for smart cities. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by the MegaSense Program at the University of Helsinki, in part by the City of Helsinki Innovation Fund (UrbanSense), in part by the European Union through the Urban Innovative Action HealthyOutdoor Premises for Everyone under Project UIA03-240, in part by the Helsinki Center for Data Science (HiDATA) Program within the Helsinki Institute for Information Technology (HIIT), in part by the Academy of Finland Centre of Excellence in Atmospheric Science under Grant 307331, in part by the NanoBiomass under Grant 307537, in part by the ACTRIS Finland under Grant 328616, in part by ACTRIS CF under Grant 329274, in part by the Regional Innovations and Experimentations Funds AIKO Governed by the Helsinki Regional Council through the Project HAQT under Grant AIKO014, in part by the Megasense Program, in part by the European Commission through ACTRIS2 under Grant 654109, in part by ACTRIS-IMP under Grant 871115, in part by the SMart URBan Solutions for Air Quality, Disasters, and City Growth under Grant 689443, in part by the ERA-NET-Cofund, University of Helsinki (ACTRISHY), in part by the European Research Council via Advanced Grant ATM-GTP under Grant 742206, and in part by the Academy Professor Project of Markku Kulmala.; Funding text 2: Manuscript received June 18, 2020; accepted July 12, 2020.

Although it has been widely recognised that different infrastructure assets are highly interconnected, infrastructure management in practice such as planning, installation and maintenance are often undertaken by different stakeholders without considering these dependencies due to the lack of relevant data and cross-domain knowledge, which may cause unexpected cascading social, economic and environmental effects. In this paper, we present a knowledge based decision support system for urban infrastructure inter-asset management. By considering various infrastructure assets (e.g. road, ground, cable), triggers (e.g. pipe leaking) and potential consequences (e.g. traffic disruption) as a holistic system, we model each sub-domain using a modular ontology and encapsulate the interdependence between them using a set of rules. Moreover, qualitative likelihood is assigned to each rule by domain experts (e.g. civil engineers) to encode the uncertainty of knowledge, and an inference engine is applied to predict the potential consequences of a given trigger with location specific data and the encoded rules. A web-based prototype system has been developed based on the above concept and demonstrated to a wide range of stakeholders. The system can assist in the process of decision making by aiding data collation and integration, as well as presenting potential consequences of possible triggers, advising on whether additional information is needed or suggesting ways of obtaining such information. The work shows an intelligent approach to integrate and process multi-source data to pioneer a novel way to aid a complex decision process with a high social impact. © 2020","Financial support from EPSRC for the Assessing the Underworld (ATU) grant (EP/K021699/1) and a follow up innovation Application Award (EP/R511717/1) is gratefully acknowledged.

It is important to identify correlations between the urbanization process and HM accumulation in the soil and predict the spatial distribution of soil HMs based on variables related to urban expansion, so that strategies for urban soil management can be created. However, accurate predictions of urban soil HMs based on predictors associated with urbanization are still lacking. In this study, 251 topsoil samples (0–20 cm) were collected using the grid-sampling method (2 km × 2 km) in a rapid urbanization area (Hefei City, China). The concentrations of As, Zn, Pb, Hg, Ni, Cu, Cr, and Cd in the soil, as well as some attributes of soil that were impacted by urbanization were determined. The areas of different land use types in a specific grid, urbanization history, and soil properties of the site were used as predictors. The overall distribution of soil HMs were then predicted using random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) models. The results showed that the concentrations of As, Zn, Pb, Hg, Cu, and Cd increased significantly with an increase in urbanization history. However, the highest concentrations of Ni and Cr were observed in soils between the 2nd and 3rd ring road. According to the RF model, soil CaO, OM, sulfur, phosphorus, and surrounded built-up area were identified as the most important factors for soil Zn, Pb, Cu, and Cd, indicating a predominant anthropogenic control of these HMs. The level of Hg in the soil was also likely related to human emissions because of the importance of urbanization history and the surrounded constructing area (CA) in governing the spatial distribution of Hg. The influence of Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>, Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>, and SiO<inf>2</inf> on soil As, Ni, and Cr indicates their primary origin from natural processes. In comparison, the SVM and RF model revealed higher R2 and lower error indices than those of the ANN model, suggesting that SVM and RF have the ability to predict urban soil HMs satisfactorily. By using independent predictors for soil HM prediction, ANN, RF, and SVM also produced significant predictions. Furthermore, the performance of the ANN, RF, SVM models were expected to be improved by introducing variables that can reflect the sources, transport, and retention of HMs in urban soils. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","We acknowledge the free use of Landsat images provided by the Geospatial Data Cloud ( http://www.gscloud.cn/ ).

Auto-3P augments the autonomous placement capabilities of MANagement and Orchestration frameworks (MANOs) by considering both resource availability at hosting nodes and the implied impact of a VNF node placement decisions on the whole service level end-to-end performance. Unlike that, most existing placement methods take a rather myopic approach after manual rule-based decisions, and/or based exclusively on a host-centric view that focuses merely on node-local resource availability and network metrics. We evaluate and validate Auto-3P with real-field trials in the context of a well-defined Smart City Safety use case using a real end-to-end application over a real city-based testbed. We meticulously conduct repeated tests to assess (i) the accuracy of our adopted prediction models; and (ii) their placement performance against three other existing MANO approaches, namely, a “Traditional”, a “Latency-aware” and a “Random” one, as well as against a collection of well-known Time Series Forecasting (TSF) methods. Our results show that the accuracy of our ML models outperforms the one by TSF models, with the most prominent accuracy performances being exhibited by models such as K-Nearest Neighbors Regression (K-NNR), Decision Tree (DT), and Support Vector Regression (SVR). What is more, the resulted end-to-end service level performance of our approach outperforms “Traditional”, “Latency-aware”, and Random MANO placement. Last, Auto-3P achieves load balancing at selected VNF hosts without degrading end-to-end service level delay, and without a need for a (fixed) overload threshold check, unlike what is suggested by other works in the literature for coping with heavy system-wide load conditions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Funding text 1: This work has received funding from the UK EPSRC project TOUCAN (EP/L020009/1), and from the EU H2020 projects 5G-VICTORI and MATILDA (grant agreements 857201, 761898).; Funding text 2: Xenofon Vasilakos is a Research Fellow with the University of Bristol, Bristol, the U.K., where he is a member of the Smart Internet Laboratory and the lead researcher of the Zero Downtime Edge Application Mobility (ZeroDEAM) project funded by Samsung Electronics UK.

Today, advanced VQA approaches model dense interactions between image regions and question words by designing co-attention mechanisms to achieve better accuracy. However, modeling interactions between each image region and each question word will force the model to calculate irrelevant information, thus causing the model’s attention to be distracted. In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose a novel model called Multi-modal Explicit Sparse Attention Networks (MESAN), which concentrates the model’s attention by explicitly selecting the parts of the input features that are the most relevant to answering the input question. We consider that this method based on top-k selection can reduce the interference caused by irrelevant information and ultimately help the model to achieve better performance. The experimental results on the benchmark dataset VQA v2 demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. Our best single model delivers 70.71% and 71.08% overall accuracy on the test-dev and test-std sets, respectively. In addition, we also demonstrate that our model can obtain better attended features than other advanced models through attention visualization. Our work proves that the models with sparse attention mechanisms can also achieve competitive results on VQA datasets. We hope that it can promote the development of VQA models and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology related to VQA in various aspects. © 2020 by the authors.

The analysis of the information gathered by sensors favors the generation of specific services and systems that not only improve the quality of life of the citizens, but also optimize the city resources. However, the difficulties of implementing this entire process in real scenarios are manifold, including the huge amount and heterogeneity of the devices, their geographical distribution, and the complexity of the necessary IT infrastructures. For this reason, the main contribution of this paper is the PADL description language, which has been specifically tailored to assist in the definition and operationalization phases of the machine learning life cycle. It provides annotations that serve as an abstraction layer from the underlying infrastructure and technologies, hence facilitating the work of data scientists and engineers. Due to its proficiency in the operationalization of distributed pipelines over edge, fog, and cloud layers, it is particularly useful in the complex and heterogeneous environments of smart cities. For this purpose, PADL contains functionalities for the specification of monitoring, notifications, and actuation capabilities. In addition, we provide tools that facilitate its adoption in production environments. Finally, we showcase the usefulness of the language by showing the definition of PADL-compliant analytical pipelines over two uses cases in a smart city context (flood control and waste management), demonstrating that its adoption is simple and beneficial for the definition of information and process flows in such environments. © 2020 by the authors.

This study’s aim is to determine what kinds of spatial structures and morphologies of waterfront green spaces offer a good cooling effect, combined with three different typical patterns in Shanghai. A multidimensional spatial influence variable system based on the cooling effect was constructed to describe the spatial structural and morphological factors of the green space network. The ENVI-met 4.3 software, developed by Michael Bruse at Bochum, German, was used to simulate the microclimate distribution data, combined with the boosted regression tree (BRT) model and the correlation analysis method. The results showed that at the network level, the distance from the water body and the connectivity of green space had a stronger cooling correlation. The orientation of green corridors consistent with a summer monsoon had larger cooling effect ranges. In terms of spatial morphology, the vegetation sky view factor (SVF) and Vegetation Surface Albedo (VSAlbedo) had an important correlation with air temperature (T), and the green corridor with a 20–25 m width had the largest marginal effect on cooling.

We introduce a coarse-to-fine hierarchy on the dataset and the model learns to simultaneously extract features and classify across both levels of hierarchy. We propose a new multiplicative layer, which is able to improve the accuracy of the finer prediction by considering the feedback signal of the coarse layers. We have quantitatively evaluated the proposed approach both on our proposed building datasets, as well as on various benchmark databases to demonstrate that the model is able to efficiently learn hierarchical information. The HierarchyNet model is able to outperform the state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks in urban building classification as well as in other multi-label classification tasks while using significantly fewer parameters. ©2020 by the authors.

Such methods require complex information regarding the number of vehicles on the roads, their positions, directions, etc. One way to obtain this information is by analyzing overhead images collected by satellites or drones, and extracting information from them through intelligent machine learning models. Thus, in this paper we propose and present a one-stage object detection model for finding vehicles in satellite images using the RetinaNet architecture and the Cars Overhead With Context dataset.

However, in these areas, high spatial heterogeneity and diversified planting structures together generate various small farmland parcels with irregular shapes that are difficult to accurately delineate. In addition, the absence of optical data caused by the cloudy and rainy climate impedes the use of time-series optical data to distinguish farmland from other land use types. Automatic delineation of farmland parcels in mountain areas is still a very difficult task. This paper proposes an innovative precise farmland parcel extraction approach supported by very high resolution(VHR) optical image and time series synthetic aperture radar(SAR) data. Firstly, Google satellite imagery with a spatial resolution of 0.55 m was used for delineating the boundaries of ground parcel objects in mountainous areas by a hierarchical extraction scheme. This scheme divides farmland into four types based on the morphological features presented in optical imagery, and designs different extraction models to produce each farmland type, respectively. The potential farmland parcel distribution map is then obtained by the layered recombination of these four farmland types. Subsequently, the time profile of each parcel in this map was constructed by five radar variables from the Sentinel-1A dataset, and the time-series classification method was used to distinguish farmland parcels from other types. An experiment was carried out in the north of Guiyang City, Guizhou Province, Southwest China. The result shows that, the producer’s accuracy of farmland parcels obtained by the hierarchical scheme is increased by 7.39% to 96.38% compared with that without this scheme, and the time-series classification method produces an accuracy of 80.83% to further obtain the final overall accuracy of 96.05% for the farmland parcel maps, showing a good performance. In addition, through visual inspection, this method has a better suppression effect on background noise in mountainous areas, and the extracted farmland parcels are closer to the actual distribution of the ground farmland. © MDPI AG.

The huge energy consumption of MEC servers challenges the establishment of smart cities and their service time powered by rechargeable batteries. In addition, Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) technique cannot utilize limited spectrum resources fully and efficiently. Therefore, Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA)-based energy-efficient task scheduling among MEC servers for delay-constraint mobile applications is important, especially in highly-dynamic vehicular edge computing networks. The various movement patterns of vehicles lead to unbalanced offloading requirements and different load pressure for MEC servers. Self-Imitation Learning (SIL)-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising machine learning technique to break through obstacles in various research fields, especially in time-varying networks. In this paper, we first introduce related MEC technologies in vehicular networks.

UAV-assisted vehicular networking research typically adopts throughput and latency as the main performance metrics. These conventional metrics, however, are not adequate to reflect the freshness of the information, an attribute that has been recently identified as a critical requirement to enable services such as autonomous driving and accident prevention. In this paper, we consider a UAV-assisted single-hop vehicular network, wherein sensors (e.g., LiDARs and cameras) on vehicles generate time sensitive data streams, and UAVs are used to collect and process this data while maintaining a minimum age of information (AoI). We aim to jointly optimize the trajectories of UAVs and find scheduling policies to keep the information fresh under minimum throughput constraints. The formulated optimization problem is shown to be mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) and generally hard to be solved. Motivated by the success of machine learning (ML) techniques particularly deep learning in solving complex problems with low complexity, we reformulate the trajectories and scheduling policies problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) where the system state space considers the vehicular network dynamics. Then, we develop deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn the vehicular environment and its dynamics in order to handle UAVs' trajectory and scheduling policy. In particular, we leverage Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) for learning the trajectories of the deployed UAVs to efficiently minimize the Expected Weighted Sum AoI (EWSA). Simulations results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design and show the deployed UAVs adapt their velocities during the data collection mission in order to minimize the AoI. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Manuscript received July 14, 2020; accepted August 30, 2020.

Many cities in these states show high growth dynamics, but little is known about the relation of conflicts and urban growth. In Afghanistan, the Taliban regime, which lasted from 1996 to 2001, caused large scale displacement of the population. People from Afghanistan migrated to neighboring countries like Iran and Pakistan, and all developments came to a halt. After the US invasion in October 2001, all the major cities in Afghanistan experienced significant population growth, in particular, driven by the influx of internally displaced persons. Maximum pressure of this influx was felt by the capital city, Kabul. This rapid urbanization, combined with very limited capacity of local authorities to deal with this growth, led to unplanned urbanization and challenges for urban planning and management. This study analyses the patterns of growth between 2001 and 2017, and the factors influencing the growth in the city of Kabul with the help of high-resolution Earth Observation-based data (EO) and spatial logistic regression modelling. We analyze settlement patterns by extracting image features from high-resolution images (aerial photographs of 2017) and terrain features as input to a random forest classifier. The urban growth is analyzed using an available built-up map (extracted from IKONOS images for the year 2001). Results indicate that unplanned settlements have grown 4.5 times during this period, whereas planned settlements have grown only 1.25 times. The unplanned settlements expanded mostly towards the west and north west parts of the city, and the growth of planned settlements happened mainly in the central and eastern parts of the city. Population density and the locations of military bases are the most important factors that influence the growth, of both planned and unplanned settlements. The growth of unplanned settlement occurs predominantly in areas of steeper slopes on the hillside, while planned settlements are on gentle slopes and closer to the institutional areas (central and eastern parts of the city). We conclude that security and availability of infrastructure were the main drivers of growth for planned settlements, whereas unplanned growth, mainly on hillsides, was driven by the availability of land with poor infrastructure. © 2020 by the authors.

This pandemic has shown that future living will need to be agile and flexible to adapt to the various changes in needs of societal populations. Digital technology has played an integral role during COVID-19, assisting various sectors of the community, and demonstrating that smart cities can provide opportunities to respond to many future societal challenges. In the decades ahead, the rise in aging populations will be one of these challenges, and one in which the needs and requirements between demographic cohorts will vary greatly. Although we need to create future smart age-friendly ecosystems to meet these needs, technology still does not feature in the WHO eight domains of an age-friendly city. This paper extends upon Marston and van Hoof’s ‘Smart Age-friendly Ecosystem’ (SAfE) framework, and explores how digital technology, design hacking, and research approaches can be used to understand a smart age-friendly ecosystem in a post-pandemic society. By exploring a series of case studies and using real-life scenarios from the standpoint of COVID-19, we propose the ‘Concept of Age-friendly Smart Ecologies (CASE)’ framework. We provide an insight into a myriad of contemporary multi-disciplinary research, which are capable to initiate discussions and bring various actors together with a positive impact on future planning and development of age-friendly ecosystems. The strengths and limitations of this framework are outlined, with advantages evident in the opportunity for towns, regions/counties, provinces, and states to take an agile approach and work together in adopting and implement improvements for the greater benefits of residents and citizens. © 2020 by the authors.

In order to solve the problem of large pedestriain flow impact in crowded metro stations, a method of in-depth learning detection based on SSD (single shot multibox detector) is proposed. The algorithm extracts the feature information of the input image, then returns the boundary box of the location on the feature map and classifies the object categories. Using the method of local feature extraction, the features of different positions, different aspect ratios and sizes are obtained, and VGG16 is used as the base network to optimise and improve the network structure. The results of simulation experiments on VOC2007 and data_sub show that the maximum value of mAP is 77% and the highest accuracy is 96.31%. Compared with other mainstream deep learning target detection methods, SSD has higher accuracy, better real-time and robustness. It can solve the problem of different pedestrian target sizes and better realise pedestrians in subway station environment.

In common perspectives, the primary goals of DTs are to reduce the uncertainty of the physical systems in real-world projects to reduce cost. Thus, this study is aimed at developing a structural schematic of a geographic information system (GIS)-enabled DT system and exploring geospatial technologies that can aid in deploying a DT system for a real-world project—in particular, for the sustainable evaluation of carbon emissions. The schematic includes three major phases: (1) data collection and visualization, (2) analytics, and (3) deployment. Three steps are designed to propose an optimal strategy to reduce carbon emissions in an urban area. In the analytics phase, mapping, machine learning algorithms, and spatial statistics are applied, mapping an ideal counterpart to physical assets. Furthermore, not only are GIS maps able to analyze geographic data that represent the counterparts of physical assets but can also display and analyze spatial relationships between physical assets. In the first step of the analytics phase, a GIS map spatially represented the most vulnerable area based on the values of carbon emissions computed according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines. Next, the radial basis function (RBF) kernel algorithm, a machine learning technique, was used to forecast spatial trends of carbon emissions. A backpropagation neural network (BPNN) was used to quantitatively determine which factor was the most influential among the four data sources: electricity, city gas, household waste, and vehicle. Then, a hot spot analysis was used to assess where high values of carbon emissions clustered in the study area. This study on the development of DTs contributes the following. First, with DTs, sustainable urban management systems will be improved and new insights developed more publicly. Ultimately, such improvements can reduce the failures of projects associated with urban planning and management. Second, the structural schematic proposed here is a data-driven approach; consequently, its outputs are more reliable and feasible. Ultimately, innovative approaches become available and services are transformed. Consequently, urban planners or policy makers can apply the system to scenario-based approaches. © 2020 by the authors.

With the deployment of deep learning or handcrafted models, these features are extracted on front-end devices, then delivered to back-end servers for advanced analysis. In this scenario, we propose a model generation, utilization and communication paradigm, aiming at strong front-end sensing capabilities for establishing better artificial visual systems in smart cities. In particular, we propose an integrated multiple deep learning models reuse and prediction strategy, which dramatically increases the feasibility of the digital retina in large-scale visual data analysis in smart cities. The proposed multi-model reuse scheme aims to reuse the knowledge from models cached and transmitted in digital retina to obtain more discriminative capability. To efficiently deliver these newly generated models, a model prediction scheme is further proposed by encoding and reconstructing model differences.

The main challenge in this problem lies in finding a model that is able to accurately recognize these type of signals in the presence of background noise and allows for real-time processing. In this paper, we present the design of a portable and low-cost device for accurate audio distress signal recognition in real urban scenarios based on deep learning models. As real audio distress recordings in urban areas have not been collected and made publicly available so far, we first constructed a database where audios were recorded in urban areas using a low-cost microphone. Using this database, we trained a deep multi-headed 2D convolutional neural network that processed temporal and frequency features to accurately recognize audio distress signals in noisy environments with a significant performance improvement to other methods from the literature. Then, we deployed and assessed the trained convolutional neural network model on a Raspberry Pi that, along with the low-cost microphone, constituted a device for accurate real-time audio recognition.

The accuracy in the urban-type LCZ (LCZ1-10), however, remains relatively low because RS data cannot provide vertical or horizontal building components in detail. Geographic information system (GIS)-based building datasets can be used as primary sources in LCZ classification, but there is a limit to using them as input data for CNN due to their incompleteness. This study proposes novel methods to classify LCZ using Sentinel 2 images and incomplete building data based on a CNN classifier. We designed three schemes (S1, S2, and a scheme fusion; SF) for mapping 50 m LCZs in two megacities: Berlin and Seoul. S1 used only RS images, and S2 used RS and building components such as area and height (or the number of stories). SF combined two schemes (S1 and S2) based on three conditions, mainly focusing on the confidence level of the CNN classifier. When compared to S1, the overall accuracies for all LCZ classes (OA) and the urban-type LCZ (OA<inf>urb</inf>) of SF increased by about 4% and 7–9%, respectively, for the two study areas. This study shows that SF can compensate for the imperfections in the building data, which causes misclassifications in S2. The suggested approach can be excellent guidance to produce a high accuracy LCZ map for cities where building databases can be obtained, even if they are incomplete. © 2020 by the authors.

Therefore, this paper proposes Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based fall detection strategy with edge computing consideration, where the global network view ability of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is used to collect the generated data from smartphone. Meanwhile, on one hand, the edge computing is exploited to put some computation tasks at the edge server by the scheduling technique. On the other hand, CNN is equipped with both edge server and smartphone, and it is leveraged to train the related data and further give the guidance of fall detection. The experimental results show that the novel fall detection strategy has a more accurate rate, transmission delay, and stability than two cutting-edge strategies. © 2020 by the authors.

Under this highly relevant and extensive heading, an approach is proposed to improve vehicle detection in smart crosswalks using machine learning models. Contrarily to classic fuzzy classifiers, machine learning models do not require the readjustment of labels that depend on the location of the system and the road conditions. Several machine learning models were trained and tested using real traffic data taken from urban scenarios in both Portugal and Spain. These include random forest, time-series forecasting, multi-layer perceptron, support vector machine, and logistic regression models. A deep reinforcement learning agent, based on a state-of-the-art double-deep recurrent Q-network, is also designed and compared with the machine learning models just mentioned. Results show that the machine learning models can efficiently replace the classic fuzzy classifier. © 2020 by the authors.

Due to the complicated background information in urban areas, how to extract building footprints from high-resolution aerial images is challenging. The recent achievements of deep learning have shed light on building extraction and other remote sensing domain tasks. However, the heavy consumption of computational resources and the design of the neural architectures became the biggest bottleneck of utilizing deep learning techniques to improve the performance. In this work, we developed a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithm, dubbed BuildingNAS, for building extraction from high-resolution aerial images. In particular, we built an efficient candidate operation set upon Separable Factorized Residual Blocks as our cell-level search space. Different from previous NAS in semantic segmentation tasks, we employed the hierarchical search space and proposed the Single-Path Sampling strategy to eliminate excessive GPU memory comsumption in searching process. In addition, we proposed an entropy regularized objective for the optimization of architecture parameters. As the result, the larger batch size can be adopted in the whole pipeline to accelerate the searching process, and make the resulted architecture more stable and accurate. We evaluated our proposed algorithm in WHUBuilding Dataset, the derived network achieved mIoU of 86.95% with only 2.05G FLOPs and 3.10 M parameters.

However, despite its strong influence on cycling behavior, cyclists’ exposure to traffic-related air pollution has been often disregarded. To close this knowledge gap, we propose a comprehensive bikeability index that comprises four sub-indices: accessibility, suitability, perceptibility, and prevailing air quality in the vicinity of cycling routes. We evaluate cyclists’ exposure to fine particulate matter and black carbon, and used open-source data, land-use regression models, deep neural networks and spatial analysis. The application of the proposed bikeability framework reveals that the inclusion of air quality makes a significant difference when calculating bikeability index in Singapore and hence it merits serious consideration. We believe that the newly developed framework will convince city planners to consider the importance of assessing cyclists’ exposure to airborne particles when planning cycling infrastructure. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Funding text 1: This research was financially supported by the National Research Foundation (NRF) , the Prime Minister’s Office, Singapore, under its Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE) program ( R–706–002–101–281 ) and also by the National University of Singapore ( R-302-000-195-133 & R-302-000-236-114 ).

Then, by using LOD 1 files as geometric inputs, this study developed a python-based microclimate simulation program based on a customized machine learning algorithm to better understand the relationship between urban morphology and outdoor temperature. The integration with the 3D geometry makes this prediction model not only useful to the scientific research, but also as an urban planning tool for environmentally sustainable design. For model development, meteorological data and urban morphology features were used to predict the daily maximum temperature, daily minimum temperature, daily daytime average temperature and daily night-time average temperature. Voting regression (VOT) based on ordinary least square and random forests was used as the regression model. The average CV-R2 and the CV-RMSE predicted by VOT for the outdoor air temperature were 0.84 and 0.52°C. Compared with ordinary least squares, VOT improved R2 by an average of 18% and RMSE by an average of 24%. Sensitivity analysis indicated the daytime temperature was inversely proportional to the aspect ratio of urban canyon streets. In tropical climates, greenery can be used as a cooling measure. A negative logarithmic relationship was found between the daily maximum temperature, daily minimum temperature and green plot ratio. This shows that as the green coverage increases, the cooling effect of greenery increases, and it is more effective to adopt greenery early in areas with less vegetation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","The authors are grateful for the support of the NRF2017VSG-AT3DCM001-020 research project funded by the National Research Foundation Singapore .

The variability of urban landscapes makes cities a challenging environment for quantifying heat exposure. Most of the existing heat hazard studies have inherent limitations on two fronts; first, the spatio-temporal granularities are too coarse, and second, the inability to track the ambient air temperature (AAT) instead of land surface temperature (LST). Overcoming these limitations requires developing models for mapping the variability in heat exposure in urban environments. We investigated an integrated approach for mapping urban heat hazards by harnessing a diverse set of high-resolution measurements, including both ground-based and satellite-based temperature data. We mounted vehicle-borne mobile sensors on city buses to collect high-frequency temperature data throughout 2018 and 2019. Our research also incorporated key biophysical parameters and Landsat 8 LST data into Random Forest regression modeling to map the hyperlocal variability of heat hazard over areas not covered by the buses. The vehicle-borne temperature sensor data showed large temperature differences within the city, with the largest variations of up to 10 °C and morning-afternoon diurnal changes at a magnitude around 20 °C. Random Forest modeling on noontime (11:30 am – 12:30 pm) data to predict AAT produced accurate results with a mean absolute error of 0.29 °C and successfully showcased the enhanced granularity in urban heat hazard mapping. These maps revealed well-defined hyperlocal variabilities in AAT, which were not evident with other research approaches. Urban core and dense residential areas revealed larger than 5 °C AAT differences from their nearby green spaces. The sensing framework developed in this study can be easily implemented in other urban areas, and findings from this study will be beneficial in understanding the heat vulnerabilities of individual communities. It can be used by the local government to devise targeted hazard mitigation efforts such as increasing green space, developing better heat-safety policies, and exposure warning for workers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Funding text 1: This research was funded by (NSF) S&CC: Smart & Connected Communities program (Grant # 1637277 ).

The privacy and security of these applications are significant in providing sustainable services in a green city. The software cloning is a severe threat which may breach the security and privacy of android applications. A centrally controlled and automated screening system across multiple app stores is inevitable to prevent the release of copyrighted or cloned copies of these apps. In this paper, we proposed IoT-enabled green city architecture for clone detection in android markets using a deep learning approach. First, the proposed system obtained an original APK file together with potential candidate cloned APKs via the cloud network. For each subject software, the system uses an APK Extractor tool to retrieve Dalvik Executable (DEX) files. The Jdex decompiler is utilized to retrieve Java source files through Dalvik Executables. Second, the AST features are extracted using ANother Tool for Language Recognition (ANTLR) parser. Third, the linear features are mined from these hierarchical structures, and Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) is applied to estimate the significance of each feature. Finally, the deep learning model is configured to detect cloned apps. The deep learning model is fine-tuned to get better accuracy. The proposed approach is analyzed on five different cloned applications collected from different android markets. The main objective of this system is to avoid the release of pirated apps with various pirated labels in multiple app markets. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089348015,Yes,China,Infrastructure,Smart Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,CNN,Classification,Develop IoT-enabled green city architecture for clone detection in android apps using deep learning,"SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 9 (Infrastructure)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

In order to prevent flood occurrence and mitigate the subsequent aftermath, urban water managers aim to predict precipitation characteristics, including peak intensity, arrival time and duration, so that they can further warn inhabitants in risky areas and take emergency actions when forecasting a pluvial flood. Previous studies that dealt with the prediction of urban pluvial flooding are mainly based on hydrological or hydraulic models, requiring a large volume of data for simulation accuracy. These methods are computationally expensive. Using a rainfall threshold to predict flooding based on a data-driven approach can decrease the computational complexity to a great extent. In order to prepare cities for frequent pluvial flood events – especially in the future climate – this paper uses a rainfall threshold for classifying flood vs. non-flood events, based on machine learning (ML) approaches, applied to a case study of Shenzhen city in China. In doing so, ML models can determine several rainfall threshold lines projected in a plane spanned by two principal components, which provides a binary result (flood or no flood). Compared to the conventional critical rainfall curve, the proposed models, especially the subspace discriminant analysis, can classify flooding and non-flooding by different combinations of multiple-resolution rainfall intensities, greatly raising the accuracy to 96.5% and lowering the false alert rate to 25%. Compared to the conventional model, the critical indices of accuracy and true positive rate (TPR) were 5%-15% higher in ML models. Such models are applicable to other urban catchments as well. The results are expected to be used to assist early warning systems and provide rational information for contingency and emergency planning. © 2020 The Authors","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank the sponsors of this work: the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant no. 2018YFE0206200 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 41671113 and 51761135024 ), the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) (Grant no.

Firstly, combined with the dynamic monitoring model of fracturing fluid, many parameters are optimized and analyzed. The velocity monitoring of fracturing fluid is realized by constructing the average velocity formula of fracturing fluid, and its approximate position is calculated. After analyzing the limitations of traditional models, the monitoring model of the unsteady friction resistance is established by summarizing the existing models and fitting the weight function by the gradient descent method. In this paper, the relationship between the pressure-time curve and crack is studied. Then the pressure curve is optimized by OPTICS algorithm improved by the adjacency list, and conduct the unsupervised learning about the stress data. By using computers, the pressure data can be clustered automatically. The classification is rapid and more accurate than the manual classification, which improves the intelligence and accuracy of data analysis, and realizes more accurate and intuitive monitoring of fractures than before. At the same time, the relationship between the city and well sites is analyzed in this paper. Combined with WITS acquisition and industrial Internet technology, the real-time data of the well site is remotely transmitted to the headquarters, which makes it possible to monitor fracturing in the city far from the well site, so that the combination of city and industry is no longer restricted by geographical location. It is beneficial to give full play to the role of industry in promoting urban development and promote the sustainable development of the city. Surface monitoring instruments have been fully utilized by using this method. This method of remote monitoring of fracturing promotes the development of intelligent city and provides a method for builders to ensure the construction safe and to make abnormal early warning of on-site fracturing. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","This work was supported by Applied Basic Research Program of Sichuan Province , China (No. 2016JY0049 ).

Previous studies on residential environmental quality (REQ) mainly focused on general evaluations at city level, while ignored the spatial heterogeneity of REQ inside cities and failed to survey REQ at local scales. This study recognizes the heterogeneity of REQ strongly related to land-use patterns, and aims to explore how local land-use patterns influence REQ. Firstly, a multimodal semantic segmentation method is presented to classify land uses by using satellite images, building data and points of interests. Secondly, a feature system is defined to characterize land-use patterns, which can be extracted at multiple scales based on land-use classification results. Thirdly, these features are fitted with REQ survey data by random forest regressions, which can predict REQ scores across Beijing and give deep insights into how land-use patterns influence REQ. Experimental results indicate that 1) REQ of Beijing is strongly heterogeneous, and our method can generate a REQ map revealing REQ's imbalance across the city; 2) land-use patterns within 700 m have significant impacts on the local REQ; 3) spatial allocations of land uses are more important than proportions for influencing REQ; and 4) our method visualizes the rules that land-use patterns influence REQ, thus can assist urban land-use planning to balance and improve REQ. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",The work presented in this paper is funded by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2019M660003 ).

Studies have shown significant associations between urban greenspaces and various health outcomes of older adults. However, most of them focused on urban parks or overall vegetation coverage, and few have considered the impact of street greenery. The lack of research attention on the latter is partly because of no method objectively measuring greenery exposure on streets, especially from a pedestrian-centered perspective. In the current study, we recruited 1161 adults aged 60 or above who lived in 12 housing estates in Wuhan, China, and collected their socio-demographic data and 7-day physical activity data. Streetscape photos were taken by trained researchers on sidewalks of all streets in the 800-m buffers from these housing estates. The pedestrian-centered street greenery exposure was extracted from these photos with the machine learning technique of convolutional neural networks along with the pyramid pooling module. Multilevel logistic regression models were conducted to examine the association of the frequency (≥4 days vs. < 4 days) and total duration (≥300 mins vs. <300 mins) of physical activity with street greenery. Park area, population density, street connectivity, and land use mix within the buffer zone, as well as individual factors, were included as covariates in the models. Results showed that street greenery was positively associated with the odds of achieving 300 mins or more of physical activity per week, but the park area was not. Furthermore, street connectivity and land use mix were positively associated with both the frequency and total time of physical activity. Unexpectedly, population density was negatively associated with the frequency and total time of physical activity. Therefore, adding street greenery or improving existing street greenery can be a vital environment-intervention strategy to create an aging-friendly urban environment. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH","The work described in this paper was fully supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51978300 ), the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special AdministrativeRegion, China (No. CityU11207520), and Science and Technology Department of Hubei Province (No. 2018CKB908 ).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088693994,Yes,China,Public Health,Active Aging,Social Equity & Quality of Life,CNN,Segmentation,Analyze association between street greenery and physical activity in older adults using ML,"SDG 3 (Health), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

Anthropogenic heat emission (AHE) is a crucial component of urban energy budget and has direct implications for investigating urban climate and environment. However, reliable and accurate representation of AHE across China is still lacking. This study presented a new machine learning-based top–down approach to generate a gridded anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) benchmark dataset at 1 km spatial resolution for China in 2010. Cubist models were constructed by fusing points-of-interest (POI) data of varying categories and multisource remote sensing data to explore the nonlinear relationships between various geographic predictors and AHE from different heat sources. The strategy of developing specific models for different components and exploiting the complementary features of POIs and remote sensing data generated a more reasonable distribution of AHF. Results showed that the AHF values in urban centers of metropolises over China range from 60 to 190 W m−2. The highest AHF values were observed in some heavy industrial zones with value up to 415 W m−2. Compared with previous studies, the spatial distribution of AHF from different heating components was effectively distinguished, which highlights the potential of POI data in improving the precision of AHF mapping. The gridded AHF dataset can serve as input of urban numerical models and can help decision makers in targeting extreme heat sources and polluters in cities and making differentiated and tailored strategies for emission mitigation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","The authors are very grateful to the three anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and constructive suggestions, which led to a significant improvement of the original manuscript.

While in power load prediction, the potential relationships between the time series of power load data and the characteristics of temperature, weather and date, have not been explored comprehensively, which degrades the accuracy of load prediction in smart grid. In order to extract the generalized features and latent relationships in power load related edge sensing data, a power load prediction scheme based on edge sensing data-imaging conversion (DIC) is proposed to improve the forecasting accuracy in smart cites and society. DIC employs empirical mode decomposition (EMD) for power load time series data and combines it with characteristic time series including temperature, weather and date to form an image-like structure. And a DIC-based convolutional neural network (DI-CNN) is presented to implement convolution.

However, existing studies do not fully exploit the underlying merit of big data. In this study, we develop a data-driven framework that integrates machine learning with spatial statistics, and then use it on Xiamen Island, China to delineate urban population dynamic patterns based on hourly Baidu heat map data collected from August 25 to September 3, 2017. The results showed that hot grids are primarily clustered along the main street through the downtown area during working days, whereas cold grids are often observed at the edge of the city during the weekend. The mixed use (of commercial and life services, restaurants and snack bars, offices, leisure areas and sports complexes) is the most significant contributing factor. A new cold grid emerged near conference venues before the Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa Summit, revealing the strong effects of regulations on population dynamics and its evolving patterns.

Repositioning democratic values of citizens’ choices in these complex ecosystems has turned out to be imperative in an era of social media filter bubbles, fake news and opportunities for manipulating electoral results with such means. This paper introduces a new paradigm of augmented democracy that promises actively engaging citizens in a more informed decision-making augmented into public urban space. The proposed concept is inspired by a digital revive of the Ancient Agora of Athens, an arena of public discourse, a Polis where citizens assemble to actively deliberate and collectively decide about public matters. The core contribution of the proposed paradigm is the concept of proving witness presence: making decision-making subject of providing secure evidence and testifying for choices made in the physical space. This paper shows how the challenge of proving witness presence can be tackled with blockchain consensus to empower citizens’ trust and overcome security vulnerabilities of GPS localization. Moreover, a novel platform for collective decision-making and crowd-sensing in urban space is introduced: Smart Agora. It is shown how real-time collective measurements over citizens’ choices can be made in a fully decentralized and privacy-preserving way. Witness presence is tested by deploying a decentralized system for crowd-sensing the sustainable use of transport means. Furthermore, witness presence of cycling risk is validated using official accident data from public authorities, which are compared against wisdom of the crowd. The paramount role of dynamic consensus, self-governance and ethically aligned artificial intelligence in the augmented democracy paradigm is outlined. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","The author would like to thank Prof. Dr. Cesar Hidalgo for his inspiring initiative on augmented democracy as well as for the honor to award to this work the Augmented Democracy Prize ( https://www.peopledemocracy.com/prize).

How to effectively leverage these data for anomaly detection has become an increasingly popular research field as it is a fundamental aspect of cyber security for smart city services. The existing methods often focus on either static data for anomaly detection or streaming data without considering the influence of poor detection accuracy caused by concept drift phenomenon. In this paper, we concentrate on the anomaly detection problem of smart city services and distinguish different anomalies of communication in an effective way, which is aimed to protect data privacy of users. Then we propose an innovative concept drift adaptive method to improve the accuracy of anomaly detection, which fully considers time influence to change the sample distribution along timeline. Furthermore, we present an AI based Improved Long Short-Term Memory (I-LSTM) neural network that adds time factor and employs a novel smooth activation function, which can enhance the performance of multi-classification for anomaly detection. Finally, our proposed methods are evaluated with a real communication dataset. Extensive experimental results indicate that I-LSTM achieves the highest values on all indicators. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed methods that can offer excellent quality of service for smart city, which is a perfect fusion of artificial intelligence and communication security. © 2020","The research is partly supported by the MOE Youth Project of Humanities and Social Sciences of China ( 20YJCZH197 ), Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province, China (1 808085MF199 ), Natural Sciences research project in Universities of Anhui Pro- vince, China ( KJ2018A0016 ), Putian technology planning project, China ( 2019GP0011 ), and Starting funds of Putian University, China ( 2019020 , 2019021 ).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085272041,Yes,China,Infrastructure,Cybersecurity,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,LSTM,Classification,Develop improved LSTM-based anomaly detection with concept drift adaptation for smart city IoT,"SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 9 (Infrastructure)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

Multiple, complex trade-offs between outcomes emerge which have both negative and positive impacts on progress towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These trade-offs are often overlooked in policy and planning processes which depend on top-down expert perspectives and rely on course grain aggregate data which does not reflect complex peri-urban dynamics or the rapid pace of change. Tools are required to address this gap, integrate data from diverse perspectives and inform more inclusive planning processes. In this paper, we draw on a reinterpretation of empirical data concerned with land-use change and multiple dimensions of food security from the city of Wuhan in China to illustrate some of the complex trade-offs between SDG goals that tend to be overlooked with current planning approaches. We then describe the development of an interactive web-based tool that implements deep learning methods for fine-grained land-use classification of high-resolution remote sensing imagery and integrates this with a flexible method for rapid trade-off analysis of land-use change scenarios. The development and potential use of the tool are illustrated using data from the Wuhan case study example. This tool has the potential to support participatory planning processes by providing a platform for multiple stakeholders to explore the implications of planning decisions and land-use policies. Used alongside other planning, engagement and ecosystem service mapping tools it can help to reveal invisible trade-offs and foreground the perspectives of diverse stakeholders. This is vital for building approaches which recognise how trade-offs between the achievement of SDGs can be influenced by development interventions. © 2020, The Author(s).","Funding text 1: The research that led directly to this paper was supported by the Sussex Sustainability Research Programme ( https://www.sussex.ac.uk/ssrp/ ) funded by the University of Sussex in partnership with the Institute of Development Studies.

The usual back propagation neural network model for building energy prediction has problems of unclear physical significance, poor data generalization and low fitting accuracy. Therefore, a composite prediction model of building power consumption based on FCM-GWO-BP neural network was proposed. According to the similar statistical distribution characteristics of data, the fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm (FCM) was used to cluster the historical power consumption data. BP neural network prediction model was established for different categories to reduce the impact of relevant noise in the sample data on the modeling accuracy. Then, according to the train and test data sets of each category, the corresponding grey wolf algorithm was established to optimize the error back propagation neural network prediction model (GWO-BP). The experimental results showed that compared with the sample prediction accuracy index root mean square percentage error (RMSPE), the GWO-BP neural network after FCM clustering was reduced by about 0.225 compared with the BP model, and was reduced by about 0.135 compared with the GWO-BP model, so its prediction accuracy was improved by 75% at most. Respectively, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was reduced by 14.41% and 6.48%. It can be seen that this model has strong generalization ability, better prediction accuracy and reliability, and absolutely can meet the needs of practical engineering. © 2020 The Authors",Key Technologies and Demonstration of Green Building Energy Consumption Management Analysis Platform Based on Big Data (2017ZDL-SF-16-5); New Generation Intelligent Building Platform Techniques (2017YFC0704100); Research on Building Energy Intelligent Supervision System for Smart Cities (17JF015).,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85080985424,Yes,China,Energy,Building Energy,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,"GWO-BP Neural Network, Improved Grey Wolf Optimizer",Prediction/Forecasting,Develop predictive model for office building energy consumption using improved GWO-BP neural network,"SDG 7 (Energy), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

Due to the existence of the imbalance between supply of drivers and demand of passengers, an accurate fine-grained taxi demand prediction in real time can help guide drivers to plan their routes and reduce the waiting time of passengers. Recently, several methods based on deep neural networks have been provided to predict taxi demands. However, these works are limited in properly incorporating multi-view features of taxi demands together, with considering the influences of context information. In this paper, we propose a convolutional recurrent network model for fine-grained taxi demand prediction. Local convolutional layers and gated recurrent units are employed in our model to extract multi-view spatial–temporal features of taxi demands. Moreover, a novel context-aware attention module is designed to incorporate the predictions of each region with considering its contextual information, which is our first attempt. We also conduct comprehensive experiments based on multiple real-world datasets in New York City and Chengdu. The experimental results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and validate the usefulness of each module in our model. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Funding text 1: This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (grant number 61802245 ); the Shanghai Sailing Program, China (grant number 18YF1408200 ); and the Science and Technology Commission Shanghai Municipality (STCSM), China (grant number 19511121000 ).

Although many prediction systems have been researched and modelled, many of them have neglected the different effects that air pollution has on each individual citizen. Hence, we present a novel context prediction model that includes context-aware computing concepts to merge an accurate air pollution prediction algorithm (using Long Short-Term Memory Deep Neural Network) with information from both surrounding pollution sources (e.g., bushfire incidents, traffic volumes) and user's health profile. This model is then integrated into a tool called My Air Quality Index (MyAQI), which is further implemented and evaluated in a real-life use case set up in Melbourne Urban Area (Victoria, Australia). Results obtained with MyAQI show both that (i) high precision levels are reached (90–96%) when forecasting air quality situations in four air quality monitoring stations, and (ii) the proposed model is highly adaptable to users’ individual health condition effects under the same airborne pollutant levels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","The research reported here was supported and funded by the PERCCOM Erasmus Mundus Program of the European Union ( PERCCOM- FPA 2013-0231 ).

Over 500 samples were collected from the abstraction point at each study site every three months between 2009 and 2019. The waterways represent a range from small to large, free flowing to reservoir impoundments, draining catchments of entirely native vegetation to those dominated by pastoral agriculture. We used machine learning algorithms to explore the relative contribution of land use, catchment geology, vegetation, topography, and water quality characteristics of the catchment to determining the abundance and/or presence of each microbe. Sites on rivers draining predominantly agricultural catchments, the Waikato River, Oroua River and Waiorohi Stream had all four microbes present, often in high numbers, throughout the sampling interval. Other sites, such as the Hutt River and Big Huia Creek in Wellington which drain catchments of native vegetation, never had pathogenic microbes detected, or unsafe levels of E. coli. Boosted Regression Tree models could predict abundances and presence/absence of all four microbes with good precision using a wide range of potential environmental predictors covering land use, geology, vegetation, topography, and nutrient concentrations. Models were more accurate for protozoa than bacteria but did not differ markedly in their ability to predict abundance or presence/absence. Environmental drivers of microbe abundance or presence/absence also differed depending on whether the microbe was protozoan or bacterial. Protozoa were more prevalent in waterways with lower water quality, higher numbers of ruminants in the catchment, and in September and December. Bacteria were more abundant with higher rainfall, saturated soils, and catchments with greater than 35% of the land in agriculture. Although modern water treatment protocols will usually remove many pathogens from drinking water, several recent outbreaks of waterborne disease due to treatment failures, have highlighted the need to manage water supplies on multiple fronts. This research has identified potential catchment level variables, and thresholds, that could be better managed to reduce the potential for pathogens to enter drinking water supplies. © 2020","Funding text 1: Thanks to Mark van Loosdrecht, Graham Wilkes and an anonymous reviewer for comments on the original manuscript that have improved the manuscript and helped tighten our conclusions.

This phenomenon is known as urban heat island (UHI). Several strategies have been proposed to mitigate the effect of urban heat islands in recent years, including usage of green roof coverage. However, there is a need for a rigorous analysis of the relationship between UHI and different urban characteristics using advanced models for urban planners to make policy-decisions to mitigate the UHI effect. In this study, the cooling effect of the green roof strategy in the city of Austin, considering 2D/3D urban characteristic parameters was investigated. To begin with, land surface temperature (LST) was estimated from Landsat 8 TIRS data in July 2016. Also, 3D urban morphology parameters derived from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. To simulate the green roof strategy, Sentinel 2A satellite images were used to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index and the normalized difference built-up index because of higher spatial resolution than Landsat 8 OLI. Then a multilayer feed-forward neural network was applied as a nonlinear model to find a relationship between LST and various urban characteristic parameters simultaneously. Furthermore, the importance of the variables in LST modeling was evaluated using sensitivity analysis. After that, some downtown residential and office buildings, which had the potential to become a green roof, were selected to implement the green roof strategy. Finally, by analyzing the relationship between LST reduction due to green roof simulation and urban indicators, the best buildings for green roof implementation were determined. Results showed that the accuracy of the LST modeling was reached to R2 = 0.786 and RMSE = 0.956 °C. In addition, by greening 3.2% of total building roofs, the average of LST decreased by 1.96 °C. Moreover, the results indicated that the building green roofs with (i) heights of 15–25 m, (ii) the highest values of sky view factor and solar radiation, and (iii) the lowest distance to the water body, had the greatest cooling effects on LST. Consequently, these findings indicated that the green roof has a significant effect on temperature reduction, especially by selecting the buildings with the above mentioned characteristics. © 2020 COSPAR",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089143121,Yes,Iran,Urban Climate,Urban Heat Island,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,"Artificial Neural Network, Urban Climate Simulation",Prediction/Forecasting,Simulate green roofs and their potential mitigating effects on urban heat island using neural network,"SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 13 (Climate)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

With a focus on (smart) mobility, the paper aims to conceptualise transport, one of the main domains of age-friendly cities as a core element of a smart, age-friendly ecosystem. It also aims to propose a justice-informed perspective for the study of age-friendly smart mobility; to contribute towards a framework for the evaluation of age-friendly smart transport as a core element of the global age-friendly cities programme that comprises mobility practices, digital data, digital networks, material/physical geographies and digital devices and access; and to introduce the term “mobility digital ecosystem” to describe this framework. The paper uses the method of a narrative literature review to weave together a selected range of perspectives from communications, transport, and mobility studies in order to introduce the embeddedness of both communication technology use and mobility practices into their material conditions. Combining insights from communications, mobility and transport and social gerontology with a justice perspective on ICT access and mobility, the paper then develops a framework to study age-friendly smart mobility.

Today, various AI applications are being used in areas ranging from marketing to banking and finance, from agriculture to healthcare and security, from space exploration to robotics and transport, and from chatbots to artificial creativity and manufacturing. More recently, AI applications have also started to become an integral part of many urban services. Urban artificial intelligences manage the transport systems of cities, run restaurants and shops where every day urbanity is expressed, repair urban infrastructure, and govern multiple urban domains such as traffic, air quality monitoring, garbage collection, and energy. In the age of uncertainty and complexity that is upon us, the increasing adoption of AI is expected to continue, and so its impact on the sustainability of our cities.

Many previous works employed Geoscience Laser Altimeter System onboard the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat/GLAS) data to assess and enhance SRTM DEM accuracy. Nevertheless, data coregistration between the two datasets was commonly neglected in their studies. In this paper, an automated and simple three dimensional (3D) coregistration method (3CM) was introduced to align the 3‐arc‐second SRTM (SRTM3) DEM and ICESat/GLAS data over Jiangxi province, China. Then, accuracy evaluation of the SRTM3 DEM using ICESat/GLAS data with and without data coregistration was performed on different classes of terrain factors and different land uses, with the purpose of evaluating the importance of data coregistration. Results show that after data coregistration, the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean bias of the SRTM3 DEM are reduced by 14.4% and 97.1%, respectively. Without data coregistration, terrain aspects with a sine‐like shape are strongly related to SRTM3 DEM errors; nevertheless, this relationship disappears after data coregistration. Among the six land uses, SRTM3 DEM produces the lowest accuracy in forest areas. Finally, by incorporating land uses, terrain factors and ICESat/GLAS data into the correction models, the SRTM3 DEM was enhanced using multiple linear regression (MLR), back propagation neural network (BPNN), generalized regression NN (GRNN), and random forest (RF), respectively. Results exhibit that the four enhancement models with data coregistration obviously outperform themselves without the coregistration. Among the four models, RF produces the best result, and its RMSE is about 3.1%, 2.7% and 11.3% lower than those of MLR, BPNN, and GRNN, respectively. Moreover, 146 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) points over Ganzhou city of Jiangxi province were used to assess the accuracy of the RF‐derived SRTM3 DEM. It is found that the DEM quality is improved and has a similar error magnitude to that relative to the ICESat/GLASS data. © 2020 by the authors.

The primary issue for the deployment of ITS based on IoV is the security for both users and infrastructures. The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is important for IoV users to keep them away from various attacks via the malware and ensure the security of users and infrastructures. In this paper, we design a data-driven IDS by analyzing the link load behaviors of the Road Side Unit (RSU) in the IoV against various attacks leading to the irregular fluctuations of traffic flows. A deep learning architecture based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed to extract the features of link loads, and detect the intrusion aiming at RSUs. The proposed architecture is composed of a traditional CNN and a fundamental error term in view of the convergence of the backpropagation algorithm. Meanwhile, a theoretical analysis of the convergence is provided by the probabilistic representation for the proposed CNN-based deep architecture.

According to the influence of traffic flow characteristics and external factors on traffic flow forecast results, the model CNN-ResNet-LSTM for urban short-term traffic flow forecasting is proposed. The model integrates convolutional neural networks(CNN), residual neural units(ResNet) and long-short-term memory networks(LSTM) into an end-to-end network framework. The convolutional neural network is used to capture the local spatial characteristics of traffic flow, and multiple residual neural units are added to deepen the network depth and improve the prediction accuracy. On the other hand, the long short-term memory-cycle neural network is used to capture temporal characteristics of traffic flow data. The output results of the two networks are combined by the corresponding weights to obtain the predicted results through the trajectory data. Finally, the traffic flow prediction values of the urban areas are obtained by fusing with external factors. Through the verification of the CNN-ResNet-LSTM model by Beijing data, the model is not only higher in accuracy than the traditional model, but also has fewer parameters in the case of ensuring the accuracy of prediction. © 2020, Editorial Department of Journal of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

It causes financial burdens on public health systems and considerable morbidity and mortality. Tropical regions in the Americas and Asia are the areas most affected by the virus. Fortaleza is a city with approximately 2.6 million inhabitants in northeastern Brazil that, during the recent decades, has been suffering from endemic dengue transmission, interspersed with larger epidemics. The objective of this paper is to study the impact of human mobility in urban areas on the spread of the dengue virus, and to test whether human mobility data can be used to improve predictions of dengue virus transmission at the neighbourhood level. We present two distinct forecasting systems for dengue transmission in Fortaleza: the first using artificial neural network methods and the second developed using a mechanistic model of disease transmission. We then present enhanced versions of the two forecasting systems that incorporate bus transportation data cataloguing movement among 119 neighbourhoods in Fortaleza. Each forecasting system was used to perform retrospective forecasts for historical dengue outbreaks from 2007 to 2015. Results show that both artificial neural networks and mechanistic models can accurately forecast dengue cases, and that the inclusion of human mobility data substantially improves the performance of both forecasting systems. While the mechanistic models perform better in capturing seasons with large-scale outbreaks, the neural networks more accurately forecast outbreak peak timing, peak intensity and annual dengue time series. These results have two practical implications: they support the creation of public policies from the use of the models created here to combat the disease and help to understand the impact of urban mobility on the epidemic in large cities. © 2020 The Author(s).","J.S., S.P. and T.Y. were supported by NIGMS grant no.

Background and Objectives: Green infrastructure and trees in particular play a key role in mitigating the urban heat island (UHI) effect. A more detailed understanding of the cooling potential of urban trees and specific tree traits is necessary to support tree management decisions for cooling our progressively hot cities. The goal of this study was to identify the influence and importance of various tree traits and site conditions. Materials and Methods: Surface temperature, air temperature at 1.1 m and at tree crown height, as well as wet bulb globe-temperature of shaded and fully sun-exposed reference areas, were used to study the cooling effect of seven different urban tree species. For all 100 individuals, tree height, crown base, trunk circumference, crown volume, crown area, leaf area index (LAI) and leaf area density (LAD) were measured. Measurements were conducted in the cities of Dresden, Salzburg, Szeged, and Vienna as representatives for middle European cities in different climate zones. Results: Beside site conditions, tree species, height, height of crown base, as well as trunk circumference, have a great influence on the cooling effect for city dwellers. The trunk circumference is a very valuable indicator for estimating climate regulating ecosystem services and therefore a highly robust estimator for policy makers and tree management practitioners when planning and managing urban green areas for improving the availability and provision of ecosystem services. © 2020 by the authors.

The objective of this research is to produce an accurate and dynamic flood modeling technique to produce flood maps as a function of water level by combining the HAND model and machine learning. In this paper, the HAND model was utilized to generate a preliminary flood map; then, the predictions of the HAND model were used to produce pseudo training samples for a R.F. model. To improve the R.F. training stage, five of the most effective flood mapping conditioning factors are used, namely, Altitude, Slope, Aspect, Distance from River and Land use/cover map. In this approach, the R.F. model is trained to dynamically estimate the flood extent with the pseudo training points acquired from the HAND model. However, due to the limited accuracy of the HAND model, a random sample consensus (RANSAC) method was used to detect outliers. The accuracy of the proposed model for flood extent prediction, was tested on different flood events in the city of Fredericton, NB, Canada in 2014, 2016, 2018, 2019. Furthermore, to ensure that the proposed model can produce accurate flood maps in other areas as well, it was also tested on the 2019 flood in Gatineau, QC, Canada. Accuracy assessment metrics, such as overall accuracy, Cohen’s kappa coefficient, Matthews correlation coefficient, true positive rate (TPR), true negative rate (TNR), false positive rate (FPR) and false negative rate (FNR), were used to compare the predicted flood extent of the study areas, to the extent estimated by the HAND model and the extent imaged by Sentinel-2 and Landsat satellites. The results confirm that the proposed model can improve the flood extent prediction of the HAND model without using any ground truth training data. © 2020 by the authors.

Connected vehicles are increasingly processing real-time data to respond immediately to user requests. However, the data must be sent to a remote cloud for processing. To resolve this issue, vehicular fog computing (VFC) has emerged as a promising paradigm that improves the quality of computation experiences for vehicles by offloading computation tasks from the cloud to network edges. Nevertheless, due to the resource restrictions of fog computing, only a limited number of vehicles are able to use it while it is still challenging to provide real-time responses for vehicular applications, such as traffic and accident warnings in the highly dynamic IoV environment. Therefore, in this article, we formulate the problem of allocating the limited fog resources to vehicular applications such that the service latency is minimized, by utilizing parked vehicles. We then propose a heuristic algorithm to efficiently find the solutions of the problem formulation. In addition, the proposed algorithm is combined with reinforcement learning to make more efficient resource allocation decisions, leveraging the vehicles' movement and parking status collected from the smart environment of the city. Our simulation results show that our VFC resource allocation algorithm can achieve higher service satisfaction compared to conventional resource allocation algorithms. © 2014 IEEE.","Manuscript received January 8, 2020; revised March 27, 2020; accepted May 7, 2020.

Then, it transforms the video data into useful information, providing services to IoT or smart city applications. However, collecting raw video data directly to the cloud server is merely possible due to network bandwidth limitations and data privacy concerns. One possible solution is to adopt federated learning, which enables edge devices to collaboratively train a shared model without sending the raw data to the cloud. Unfortunately, this scheme cannot directly be applied to the targeted scenario since it assumes labeled data for training, and only at the cloud, we have the human power and time to label the video data. Thus, to tackle those issues, we propose an edge learning system based on semisupervised learning and federated learning technologies. The system trains AI models at edge devices using an improved semisupervised learning scheme and periodically uploads the training results to the cloud server to form a single model by adapting the federated learning technology. Then, we observe that in the real world, the data on the end devices are nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) such that it may cause weight divergence during training and result in a considerable decrease in the model performance. Therefore, we propose a new operation called federated swapping (FedSwap) to replace partial federated learning operations based on a few shared data during federated training to alleviate the adverse impact of weight divergence. We evaluate our system on both image classification using the state-of-the-art benchmark data and object detection using real-world video data. The experimental results show that the proposed system can have up to 5.9% higher accuracy of object detection for the video analysis applications by fully utilizing unlabeled data, compared with the situation that only labeled data are used. Moreover, the proposed FedSwap can improve the accuracy of image classification by 3.8% and the object detection task by 1.1%. © 2014 IEEE.","Funding text 1: Manuscript received December 15, 2019; revised March 7, 2020 and April 21, 2020; accepted May 5, 2020.

Unavailability of free parking spaces is one of the major reasons for traffic jams. Congestion and parking are interrelated because searching for a free parking spot creates additional delays and increase local circulation. In the center of large cities, 10% of the traffic circulation is due to cruising, as drivers nearly spend 20 min searching for free parking space. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a parking space availability prediction system that can inform the drivers in advance about the location-wise, day-wise, and hour-wise occupancy of parking lots. In this paper, we proposed a framework based on a deep long short term memory network to predict the availability of parking space with the integration of Internet of Things (IoT), cloud technology, and sensor networks. We use the Birmingham parking sensors dataset to evaluate the performance of deep long short term memory networks. Three types of experiments are performed to predict the availability of free parking space which is based on location, days of a week, and working hours of a day. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art prediction models. © 2020 by the authors.

However, the anthropogenic driving mechanisms of ecosystem services are poorly understood. Here, we established a deep learning model to approximate the ecosystem service value (ESV) of Nanjing City using 23 socioeconomic factors. A multi-view analysis was then conducted on feasible impact mechanisms using model disassembly. The results indicated that certain factors had their own significant and independent effects on ESV, such as the proportion of water areas in the land-use structure and the output value of the secondary industry. The proportion of ecological water should be increased as much as possible, whereas the output value of the secondary industry should be reasonably controlled in Nanjing. Other intrinsically related factors were likely to be composited together to affect ESV, such as industrial water consumption and industrial electricity consumption. In Nanjing, simultaneously optimizing socio-economic factors related to city size, resources, and energy use efficiency likely represents an effective management strategy for maintaining and enhancing regional ecological service capabilities. The results of this work suggest that deep learning is an effective method of deepening studies on the prediction of ESV trends and human-driven mechanisms. © 2020 Liu et al.

However, modelling these large-scale structures remains a challenge, due to their sheer size as physical objects. Despite recent improvements in processing power and computing methods, extensive time periods are still required for ordinary microprocessors to model network centralities in road-graphs with high element counts, connectivity and topological depth. Generalization is often the chosen option to mitigate time-constraints of regional network complexity. Nevertheless, this can impact visual representation and model precision, especially when multiscale comparisons are desired. Tests using Normalized Angular Choice (NACH), a Space Syntax mathematical derivative of Betweenness Centrality, found recursive visual similitudes in centrality spatial distribution when modelling distinct scaled map sections of the same large regional network structure. Therefore, a sort of homothetic behavior is identified, since statistical analyses demonstrate that centrality values and distributions remain rather consistent throughout scales, even when considering edge effects.

Therefore, to study a set of effective management mode for the safe operation of urban logistics and improve the risk prediction mechanism, is the primary research item of urban logistics security management. This paper summarizes the risk factors to public security in the process of urban logistics, including pick up, warehouse storage, transport, and the end distribution. Generalized regression neural network (GRNN) is combined with particle swarm optimization (PSO) to predict accidents, and the Apriori algorithm is used to analyze the combination of high-frequency risk factors. The results show that the method of combining GRNN with PSO is effective in accident prediction and has a powerful generalization ability. It can prevent the occurrence of unnecessary urban logistics public accidents, improve the ability of relevant departments to deal with emergency incidents, and minimize the impact of urban logistics accidents on social and public security. ©: © 2020 Zhao et al.

Notably, the urban heat island phenomenon is becoming more prominent in megacities and their hinterlands in temperate and subtropical climatic regions. In the daytime in summer, there exists a high possibility of accelerating the land surface temperature (LST) in desert cities, due to the alterations made by human beings in the natural environment. In this study, we investigate the spatial formation of LST in a tropical sub-Saharan city of Accra, a gateway to West Africa, using Landsat data in 2003 and 2017. Machine learning techniques and the different spatial and statistical methods such as tasseled cap transformation (TCT), urban-rural gradient, and multiresolution grid-based and landscape metrics were employed to examine procured land use/cover (LUC) and LST maps. LUC was classified into five categories: Built up, Green 1, Green 2, Bare land, and Water. The results of the analysis indicate that Built up, Green 2, and Bare land had caused the highest heating effect while Green 1 and Water had caused the considerable cooling effect during the daytime in Accra. The urban-rural difference in LST recorded 1.4 °C in 2003 and 0.28 °C in 2017. The mean size, mean shape, largest patch, and aggregation of Built up, Green 1, and Green 2 had a strong relationship with the mean LST. It is essential for urban planners to carefully examine the formation and effect of the urban heat island (UHI) for sustainable urban development and landscape policy toward mitigation and adaptation planning in Accra. © 2020 by the authors.",Funding: This study was partly supported by the JSPS grant 18H00763 (2018-20).,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092127589,Yes,Japan,Urban Climate,Urban Heat Island,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,"Remote Sensing, Urban Heat Island Analysis",Classification,Investigate spatial variation of land use/cover composition and impact on surface urban heat island,"SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 13 (Climate)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

It is essential to make society aware of the facts and to educate the population about the advantages that new technologies can provide for efficient urban development. We therefore ask whether an ordinary medium-sized city can become a Smart City. In order to assess this possibility, our study analyzes different models of Smart Cities implemented in Spain (e.g., Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Malaga and Santander), contrasting them with the specific case of one city that is not yet a Smart City (Granada) in order to discuss which strategic technological actions to implement in different topical areas of action: the economy, sustainability, mobility, government, population, and quality of life. The study uses Cohen's wheel to give researchers in the field a series of indicators and factors that can be used to analyze public data with statistical methods in order to obtain clear positive scores for Madrid and Barcelona. The analysis shows Granada's deficiencies in the scores for digital government, accessibility, the efficiency of public transport, and mobility, among others.

However, while the field is rich with case studies, methods that provide rich data across municipalities and potentially at global scale remain underdeveloped, and comparative insights remain scarce. Here we summarize contributions to the focus issue on 'Systematizing and Upscaling Urban Climate Solutions', also drawing from presentations given at an accompanying conference in 2018. We highlight four core areas for systematizing and upscaling urban climate mitigation solutions. First, with more and better (big) data and associated machine learning methods, there is increasing potential to compare types of cities and leverage collective understanding. Second, while urban climate assessments have mostly emphasized urban planning, demand-side action as related to both behavioral change and modified social practices relevant to urban space deserve more academic attention and integration across a diverse set of social sciences. Third, climate mitigation would be intangible as a single objective at the urban scale, and measures and solutions that coordinate mitigation coherently with adaptation and broader sustainable development goals require explicit conceptualization and systematization. Forth, all insights should come together to develop governance frameworks that translate scientific exercises into concrete, realistic and organized action plans on the ground, for all cities. © 2020 The Author(s).

According to the World Health Organization, noise pollution from traffic and other human activities, negatively impact the population health and life quality. Monitoring noise usually requires the use of professional and expensive instruments, called phonometers, able to accurately measure sound pressure levels. In many cases, phonometers are human-operated; therefore, periodic fine-granularity city-wide measurements are expensive. Recent advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) offer a window of opportunities for low-cost autonomous sound pressure meters. Such devices and platforms could enable fine time–space noise measurements throughout a city. Unfortunately, low-cost sound pressure sensors are inaccurate when compared with phonometers, experiencing a high variability in the measurements. In this paper, we present RaveGuard, an unmanned noise monitoring platform that exploits artificial intelligence strategies to improve the accuracy of low-cost devices. RaveGuard was initially deployed together with a professional phonometer for over two months in downtown Bologna, Italy, with the aim of collecting a large amount of precise noise pollution samples. The resulting datasets have been instrumental in designing InspectNoise, a library that can be exploited by IoT platforms, without the need of expensive phonometers, but obtaining a similar precision. In particular, we have applied supervised learning algorithms (adequately trained with our datasets) to reduce the accuracy gap between the professional phonometer and an IoT platform equipped with low-end devices and sensors. Results show that RaveGuard, combined with the InspectNoise library, achieves a 2.24% relative error compared to professional instruments, thus enabling low-cost unmanned city-wide noise monitoring. © 2020 by the authors.

The method consists of a three-step solution that promotes an affordable implementation in a relatively small time period. More specifically, a 3D Computer Aided Design (CAD) of the PTC was used for the pre-training of neural networks, while an aluminum reflector surface was used to verify algorithm performance. The results are promising, as this method proved applicable in cases where the actual part was manufactured in small batches or under the concept of customized manufacturing.

Due to the characteristics of complicated and volatile traffic scenarios, fast and accurate modelling and processing requirements are vital for traffic service, such as traffic congestion solutions. Traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach can make decisions autonomously, but its complex network structure leads to time-consuming training and updating processes. In addition, it is not always feasible to provide a large amount of tagged data in real life. To solve these problems, this study proposes a semi-supervised double duelling broad reinforcement learning (semi-DDBRL) approach based on the broad reinforcement learning (BRL). It incorporates some algorithmic improvements into the BRL, such as duelling network and double Q-learning network, and adds semi-supervised learning to improve the accuracy of modelling and decision making. As a case study of smart city applications, the authors apply the proposed semi-DDBRL approach to the problem of traffic congestion. Based on the experiments, their approach can have a faster execution time than the DRL approach.

Noise pollution levels are very important today, especially in cities where the number of inhabitants and disturbing sounds are constantly increasing. Psycho-acoustic parameters are a fundamental tool for assessing the degree of discomfort produced by different sounds and, combined with wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs), could enable, for example, the efficient implementation of acoustic discomfort maps within smart cities. However, the continuous monitoring of psycho-acoustic parameters to create time-dependent discomfort maps requires a high computational demand that prevents real-time computations within the nodes. Moreover, sending audio streams outside of the WASN for their further computation, would require extra communication and computational efforts without warranting a real-time monitoring, with the added problem of violating some privacy laws. As a result, most existing systems for nuisance assessment are usually based on less accurate indicators that require lower computational cost. In this paper, we describe the design and analysis of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained with a big dataset of typical sounds occurrying in a city. The CNN allows to predict the psycho-acoustic parameters considered by the well-known Zwicker's psycho-acoustic nuisance model with great accuracy, directly from the raw recorded audio signal. The proposed CNN-based system has been tested on both desktop computers and typical WASN devices (such as Raspberry Pi), achieving very fast calculation times that allow real-time operation and a continuous monitoring of psycho-acoustic parameters. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Manuscript received February 13, 2020; accepted May 17, 2020.

The solution uses data of accelerometer and Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors available in smartphones carried by the commuters. These data are used to accurately identify bus boarding event and whether a commuter got a seat during his/her trip. The solution is energy efficient as it uses power hungry GPS very conservatively and keeps it off majority of the times. The solution is evaluated using data collected over the arterial roads of Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar city. The length of routes varies from 25 to 45 kilometers. The effect of application penetration on crowdedness detection in buses is also evaluated. It is found that the penetration of 8 to 12% in commuter population can detect the crowdedness for more than 80% of route segments on the test routes. Further, the solution results in the energy-saving of about 50% compared to a solution that requires GPS data continuously.

LiDAR point clouds are structured, which provides an opportunity to convert the 3D data to a 2D array, represented as range images. Thus, we cast the LiDAR point clouds compression as a range images coding problem. Inspired by the high efficiency video coding (HEVC) algorithm, we design a novel coding architecture for the point cloud sequence. The scans are divided into two categories: intra-frames and inter-frames. For intra-frames, a cluster-based intra-prediction technique is utilized to remove the spatial redundancy. For inter-frames, we design a prediction network model using convolutional LSTM cells, which is capable of predicting future inter-frames according to the encoded intra-frames. Thus, the temporal redundancy can be removed. Experiments on the KITTI data set show that the proposed method achieves an impressive compression ratio, with 4.10% at millimeter precision.

Therefore, they are a constant security risk that seriously threaten the public security of the city. Due to the complexity of the underground environment, lack of various monitoring technologies, high cost, backwardness of emergency technology research, incongruity of safety management, and the transport of flammable, explosive, toxic, and harmful hazardous sources to densely populated areas, the boundary between industrial, residential, and living areas has become increasingly blurred, causing a major threat to public security, people's lives, industrial production, and social stability. Traditional underground pipeline accident prevention and control technology is currently unable to meet the increasing demands of public security. Combining pipeline accident prevention and control with internet of things and artificial intelligence technology can achieve urban disaster prevention, and therefore is of great interest to researchers. Herein, the research status of underground pipeline accident prevention and control technology is summarized, and an analysis of the advantages of applying big data for risk factor monitoring, risk assessment, risk early warning, and emergency decision-making technology is discussed.

It refers to the ability to clone a physical object (PO) into a software counterpart. The softwarized object, termed logical object, reflects all the important properties and characteristics of the original object within a specific application context. To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars), multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the 'softwarization' of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in order to present a general functional framework for the DT. This article, eventually, analyses a set of possible evolution paths for the DT considering its possible usage as a major enabler for the softwarization process. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087488936,Yes,France,Infrastructure,Smart Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"Digital Twin, IoT, Simulation",Simulation,"Survey digital twin technical features, scenarios, and architectural models for IoT","SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 9 (Infrastructure)",Review/Survey,Qualitative,Global,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

With the growth of connected things, the most-widely used centralized (cloud-based) IDS often suffers from high latency and network overhead, thereby resulting in unresponsiveness to attacks and slow detection of malicious users. In this paper, we address the limitation of centralized IDS for resource-constrained devices by proposing two methods, namely semi-distributed and distributed, that combine well-performing feature extraction and selection and exploit potential fog-edge coordinated analytics. In order to distribute the computational tasks, we individually develop parallel machine-learning models corresponding to a partitioned attack dataset. In the semi-distributed case, the parallel models, running on the edge side, are applied for side-by-side feature selections, which are then followed by a single multi-layer perceptron classification running on the fog side. In the distributed case, the parallel models individually perform both the feature selection and multi-layer perceptron classification after which the outputs are combined by a coordinating edge or fog for final decision making. Based on the comparative study of existing works, the numerical results demonstrate the promise of the proposed methods, giving a comparable detection accuracy to the superior centralized IDS as well as exemplify their inherent trade-offs between the accuracy and building time performance. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","This work was partially supported by a Research Grant ( RDU192202 ), which is funded by University Malaysia Pahang .",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087279989,Yes,Malaysia,Infrastructure,Cybersecurity,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"Machine Learning, Intrusion Detection, IoT Security",Classification,Develop scalable ML-based intrusion detection system for IoT-enabled smart cities,"SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 9 (Infrastructure)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

This has led to the concept of Smart cities where Information Communication and Technology (ICT) is merged with the existing traditional infrastructure of a city which is then coordinated and managed using digital technology. This idea of smart cities is slowly but surely coming into reality as many countries around the globe are adopting this idea and coming up with their own model of smart cities. At the core of smart city lies the sensors and actuators embedded in the smart devices that sense the environment for facilitating effective decision making. The microcontrollers available in these devices are programmed to take decisions automatically based on the information received from the sensors. This involves integration of several information and communication technologies like artificial intelligence, protocols, Internet of things (IoT), wireless sensor network (WSN) etc. This paper discusses and extensively reviews the role of enabling technologies in smart cities. The paper further highlights the challenges and limitations in the development of smart cities along with the mitigation strategies. Specifically, three categories of challenges are identified namely technical, socio-economic and environmental giving specifics of each category.

Due to various uncertain factors in the real-world scenarios, (e.g., resolution variation, viewpoint variation, illumination changes, occlusion, etc., vehicle Re-ID is a very challenging task. To resist the adverse effect of resolution variation, a joint pyramid feature representation network (JPFRN) for vehicle Re-ID is proposed in this paper. Based on the consideration that various convolution blocks with different depths hold different resolutions and semantic information of the vehicle image, the proposed JPFRN method employs a base network to obtain multi-resolution vehicle features in the first stage. Then, a pyramid feature representation scheme is developed to reconstruct and integrate the obtained multi-resolution vehicle features together. Finally, these pyramid features are jointly represented for learning a more discriminative feature under the supervision of joint Triplet loss and softmax loss. Extensive experimental results on two commonly-used vehicle databases (i.e., VehicleID and VeRi) show that the proposed JPFRN is superior to multiple recently-developed vehicle Re-ID methods. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under the grants 61871434, 61602191, and 61802136, in part by the Natural Science Foundation for Outstanding Young Scholars of Fujian Province under the grant 2019J06017, in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province under the grant 2017J05103, in part by the Fujian-100 Talented People Program, in part by the Key Science and Technology Project of Xiamen City under the grant 3502ZCQ20191005, in part by High-level Talent Innovation Program of Quanzhou City under the grant 2017G027, in part by the Promotion Program for Young and Middle-aged Teacher in Science and Technology Research of Huaqiao University under the grants ZQN-YX403 and ZQN-PY418, and in part by the High-Level Talent Project Foundation of Huaqiao University under the grants 14BS201, 14BS204 and 16BS108, and in part by the Subsidized Project for Postgraduates Innovative Fund in Scientific Research of Huaqiao University.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086389141,Yes,China,Transportation,Traffic Management,Urban Mobility & Transportation,CNN,Classification,Develop joint pyramid feature representation network for vehicle re-identification in smart cities,SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities),Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Weak

It requires the ability to examine the relationships between urban built environment features and traffic congestion situations. This article presents a novel and effective approach for achieving the task based on a machine-learning technique and publicly available street-view imagery and point-of-interest (POI) data. The proposed multiple-graph-based convolutional network architecture can: (a) extract essential urban built environment features from street-view imagery and neighboring POIs; (b) model the spatial dependencies between traffic congestion on road networks via graph convolution; and (c) evaluate the risk level of road intersections to emerging congestion situations based on local built environment features. We apply the model to Wuhan in China, and predict the potential congestion spots across the city. The results confirm that the model prediction is highly consistent (about 85.5%) when compared to the ground-truth data based on traffic indices derived from a big taxi GPS trajectory dataset.

As one of the main applications, the Internet of Vehicles has been developing rapidly. However, privacy leakage and delay problem for data collection remain as the key concerns behind the fast development of the cyber intelligence technologies. If the original data collected are directly uploaded to the cloud for processing, it will bring huge load pressure and delay to the network communication. Moreover, during this process, it will lead to the leakage of data privacy. To this end, in this article we design a data collection and preprocessing scheme based on deep learning, which adopts the semisupervised learning algorithm of data augmentation and label guessing. Data filtering is performed at the edge layer, and a large amount of similar data and irrelevant data are cleared. If the edge device cannot process some complex data independently, it will send the processed and reliable data to the cloud for further processing, which maximizes the protection of user privacy.

The study of location semantics has attracted increasing attention in diverse fields due to its wide applications such as location retrieval, location recommendation, data preprocessing and so on. Established inference approaches tend to manually discover the spatiotemporal pattern of unique location as features for training classifiers. However, extracting valuable spatiotemporal patterns or features is a non-trivial task. In this paper, we propose a novel location semantic inference with graph convolutional networks (SI-GCN). We introduce node2vec and variational autoencoder to learn spatial and temporal features of location, respectively. Furthermore, we leverage graph convolutional networks to capture high order relations in user's check-in activity with building a user-location bipartite network. And leveraging self-attention mechanism is allowed to distinguish contributions of the different nodes.

This paper integrates different types of big data and combines the theories on the interaction between transport and land use. By taking Beijing as a case, we firstly analyze the metro trip purposes of individual passengers using travel survey data from 5565 respondents. Secondly, we investigate the land use features of trip origin and destination using Point of Interest(POI) data. Thirdly, a metro trip dataset is developed which includes the information of trip purpose, trip duration, and spatial distribution of trip origin and destination. Fourthly, a Random Forest (RF) algorithm is used to establish a RF classifier using the metro trip dataset as training data. Finally, this trained classifier is used to classify each metro trip recorded by the SCD to identify the metro trip purpose and the spatial distribution of metro trips for different purposes. The results of analysis show that the random forest classifier trained in this study can effectively identify metro trip purposes from SCD. For trips with ""go to work"" and ""go home"" purposes, the accuracy of identification can reach over 90%. One reason for the high identification accuracy is that land use information is included in the RF classifier. Our results confirm the theory of spatial-temporal interactions between transport and land use. There is an increasing availability of multi-source geographic big data and traffic survey data of residents in large cities, which means that the method developed in this study would have a high value in metro trip predicting and monitoring, transport planning, and land use policy-making around the metro stations.

Consequently, the burden of malaria is increasingly affecting the urban population, while socio-economic inequalities within the urban settings are intensified. Few studies, relying mostly on moderate to high resolution datasets and standard predictive variables such as building and vegetation density, have tackled the topic of modeling intra-urban malaria at the city extent. In this research, we investigate the contribution of very-high-resolution satellite-derived land-use, land-cover and population information for modeling the spatial distribution of urban malaria prevalence across large spatial extents. As case studies, we apply our methods to two Sub-Saharan African cities, Kampala and Dar es Salaam. Methods: Openly accessible land-cover, land-use, population and OpenStreetMap data were employed to spatially model Plasmodium falciparum parasite rate standardized to the age group 2-10 years (PfPR2-10) in the two cities through the use of a Random Forest (RF) regressor. The RF models integrated physical and socio-economic information to predict PfPR2-10 across the urban landscape. Intra-urban population distribution maps were used to adjust the estimates according to the underlying population. Results: The results suggest that the spatial distribution of PfPR2-10 in both cities is diverse and highly variable across the urban fabric. Dense informal settlements exhibit a positive relationship with PfPR2-10 and hotspots of malaria prevalence were found near suitable vector breeding sites such as wetlands, marshes and riparian vegetation. In both cities, there is a clear separation of higher risk in informal settlements and lower risk in the more affluent neighborhoods. Additionally, areas associated with urban agriculture exhibit higher malaria prevalence values. Conclusions: The outcome of this research highlights that populations living in informal settlements show higher malaria prevalence compared to those in planned residential neighborhoods. This is due to (i) increased human exposure to vectors, (ii) increased vector density and (iii) a reduced capacity to cope with malaria burden. Since informal settlements are rapidly expanding every year and often house large parts of the urban population, this emphasizes the need for systematic and consistent malaria surveys in such areas. Finally, this study demonstrates the importance of remote sensing as an epidemiological tool for mapping urban malaria variations at large spatial extents, and for promoting evidence-based policy making and control efforts. © 2020 The Author(s).","This research was funded by BELSPO (Belgian Federal Science Policy Office) in the frame of the STEREO III program, as part of the REACT (SR/00/337) project.

The main driving factors of spatiotemporal differentiation of construction land use intensity in China were analyzed by using geographically weighted regression model (GWR). The results show that from 2000 to 2015, China's construction land use intensity showed an overall upward trend, and the spatial difference was significant. The high-intensity utilization level was mainly concentrated in the Bohai Rim Economic Zone, major coastal cities and provincial capital cities. The intensity of china's construction land utilization presented spatial self-correlation, and the global pattern of separation was basically consistent with the pattern of cold hot spot distribution and spatial heterogeneity. The spatial pattern evolution of China's construction land use intensity was mainly affected by four factors: economic development level, industrial structure, urbanization level and government economic regulation.

J., ","The characteristics of urban land surfaces contribute to the urban heat island, and, in turn, can exacerbate the severity of heat wave impacts. However, the mechanisms and complex interactions in urban areas underlying land surface temperature are still being understood. Understanding these mechanisms is necessary to design strategies that mitigate land temperatures in our cities. Using the recently available night-time moderate-resolution thermal satellite imagery and employing advanced nonlinear statistical models, we seek to answer the question “What is the influence and relative importance of urban characteristics on land surface temperature, during both the day and night?” To answer this question, we analyze urban land surface temperature in four cities across the United States. We devise techniques for training and validating nonlinear statistical models on geostatistical data and use these models to assess the interdependent effects of urban characteristics on urban surface temperature. Our results suggest that vegetation and impervious surfaces are the most important urban characteristics associated with land surface temperature. While this may be expected, this is the first study to quantify this relationship for Landsat-resolution nighttime temperature estimates. Our results also demonstrate the potential for using nonlinear statistical analysis to investigate land surface temperature and its relationships with urban characteristics. Improved understanding of these relationships influencing both night and day land surface temperature will assist planners undertaking climate change adaptation and heat wave mitigation. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Funding text 1: The work was funded by the US National Science Foundation's Grant SEES-1631409 and a University of Michigan Rackham PreDoctoral Fellowship.

In order to materialize this concept, a new generation of adaptable systems of intelligent supervisory predictive control (ISPC) is introduced and implemented in which energy consumption tends to be minimized without sacrificing occupants thermal comfort. The methodology of ISPC includes building thermal simulation and multi-objective optimization algorithm that interact with conventional machine-level controllers of HVAC systems, to define optimized setpoints considering current and forecasted operation conditions. The development of a reliable surrogate model, based on robust machine learning techniques, is a key feature to confer greenness to a building in order to promote sustainability in the built environment and finally to have a smart green building. It is showed that the proposed ISPC is capable of delivering a robust, energy- and cost-effective decision while being independent of the HVAC system.

This increasingly interconnected web of products, processes, services, and infrastructure is often invisible to the user, as are the resource costs behind them. This ecosystem of machine-to-machine and cyber-physical-system technologies has a myriad of (in)direct impacts on the lithosphere, biosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere. As key determinants of tomorrow's digital world, academic institutions are critical sites for exploring ways to mitigate and/or eliminate negative impacts. This Report is a self-deliberation provoked by the question How do we create more resilient and healthier computer science departments: living laboratories for teaching and learning about resource-constrained computing, computation, and communication? Our response for University College London (UCL) Computer Science is to reflect on how, when, and where resources - energy, (raw) materials including water, space, and time - are consumed by the building (place), its occupants (people), and their activities (pedagogy). This perspective and attendant first-of-its-kind assessment outlines a roadmap and proposes high-level principles to aid our efforts, describing challenges and difficulties hindering quantification of the Department's resource footprint. Qualitatively, we find a need to rematerialise the ICT/EEE ecosystem: to reveal the full costs of the seemingly intangible information society by interrogating the entire life history of paraphernalia from smartphones through servers to underground/undersea cables; another approach is demonstrating the corporeality of commonplace phrases and Nature-inspired terms such as artificial intelligence, social media, Big Data, smart cities/farming, the Internet, the Cloud, and the Web. We sketch routes to realising three interlinked aims: cap annual power consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, become a zero waste institution, and rejuvenate and (re)integrate the natural and built environments. © The Author(s), 2020.

However, the real-time processing of collected data on edge in the context of the Internet-of-Drones remains an open challenge because UAVs have limited energy capabilities, while computer vision techniquesconsume excessive energy and require abundant resources. This fact is even more critical when deep learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are used for classification and detection. In this paper, we first propose a system architecture of computation offloading for Internet-connected drones. Then, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study to evaluate the performance in terms of energy, bandwidth, and delay of the cloud computation offloading approach versus the edge computing approach of deep learning applications in the context of UAVs. In particular, we investigate the tradeoff between the communication cost and the computation of the two candidate approaches experimentally. The main results demonstrate that the computation offloading approach allows us to provide much higher throughput (i.e., frames per second) as compared to the edge computing approach, despite the larger communication delays. © 2020 by the authors.

However, these major advantages also come at a great cost. Since agents’ mental states are hidden when the implementation is not known and available, intelligent services of smart cities cannot leverage information from them. We contribute with a proposal for the analysis and prediction of hidden agents’ mental states in a multi-agent system using machine learning methods that learn from past agents’ interactions. The approach employs agent communication languages, which is a core property of these multi-agent systems, to infer theories and models about agents’ mental states that are not accessible in an open system. These mental state models can be used on their own or combined to build protocol models, allowing agents (and their developers) to predict future agents’ behavior for various tasks such as testing and debugging them or making communications more efficient, which is essential in an ambient intelligence environment. This paper’s main contribution is to explore the problem of building these agents’ mental state models not from one, but from several interaction protocols, even when the protocols could have different purposes and provide distinct ambient intelligence services. © 2020 by the authors.

The intelligent and connected transportation system (ICTS) is an essential part of this ecosystem that provides new real-time applications. The emerging applications are based on Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies, which bring out new challenges, such as heterogeneity and scalability, and they require innovative communication solutions. The existing routing protocols cannot achieve these requirements due to the surrounding knowledge supported by individual nodes and their neighbors, displaying partial visibility of the network. However, the issue grew ever more arduous to conceive routing protocols to satisfy the ever-changing network requirements due to its dynamic topology and its heterogeneity. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) offers the latest view of the entire network and the control of the network based on the application’s specifications. Nonetheless, one of the main problems that arise when using SDN is minimizing the transmission delay between ubiquitous nodes. In order to meet this constraint, a well-attended and realistic alternative is to adopt the Machine Learning (ML) algorithms as prediction solutions. In this paper, we propose a new routing protocol based on SDN and Naive Bayes solution to improve the delay. Simulation results show that our routing scheme outperforms the comparative ones in terms of end-to-end delay and packet delivery ratio. © 2020 by the authors.

If there are many shops and restaurants in close proximity, various activities can be done by walking or cycling, and a car is not needed. It is also more difficult (e.g., parking space, traffic jams) to use a car in high-density areas. Overall, travel behavior and dependencies on travel behavior are influenced by urbanity. These relationships have so far only been examined very selectively (e.g., at city level) and not in international comparison. In this study we define an Urbanity Index (UI) at zip code level, which considers factors influencing mobility, international comparability, reproducibility as well as practical application and the development of a scalable methodology. In order to describe urbanity, data were collected regarding spatial structure, population, land use, and public transport. We developed the UI using a supervised machine learning technique which divides zip codes into four area types: (1) super-urban, (2) urban, (3) suburban/small town, (4) rural. To train the model, the perception from experts in known zip codes concerning urbanity and mobility was set as ground truth.

This study utilizes the wireless sensor network technology and designs urban surface thermal environment monitoring nodes. Three typical underlying surfaces are selected for long-term continuous observation, and four machine learning algorithms are used to estimate the historical temperature of three typical underlying surfaces. Results show that the XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) model has the best effect (MAE<1.0, R2>0.94), with the advantages of high accuracy and strong generalization ability.

However, current methods using traditional surveys cannot meet the demand for the rapid development of urban land management. There is an urgent need to develop new methods to overcome the shortcomings of conventional methods. To address the issue, this study used the random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN) models to build machine-leaning methods for urban land-use classification. Taking Hangzhou as an example, these machine-leaning methods could all successfully classify the essential urban land use into 6 Level I classes and 13 Level II classes based on the semantic features extracted from Sentinel-2A images, multi-source features of types of points of interest (POIs), land surface temperature, night lights, and building height. The validation accuracy of the RF model for the Level I and Level II land use was 79.88% and 71.89%, respectively, performing better compared to SVM (78.40% and 68.64%) and ANN models (71.30% and 63.02%). However, the variations of the user accuracy among the methods depended on the urban land-use level. For the Level I land-use classification, the user accuracy was high, except for the transportation land by all methods. In general, the RF and SVM models performed better than the ANN model. For the Level II land-use classification, the user accuracy of different models was quite distinct. With the RF model, the user accuracy of educational and medical land was above 80%. Moreover, with the SVM model, the user accuracy of the business office and educational land classification was above 75%. However, the user accuracy of the ANN model on the Level II land-use classification was poor. Our results showed that the RF model performs best, followed by SVM model, and ANN model was relatively poor in the essential urban land-use classification. The results proved that the use of machine-learning methods can quickly extract land-use types with high accuracy, and provided a better method choice for urban land-use information acquisition. © 2020 by the authors.

It is urgent to design efficient warning strategies for rear-end collisions which is one of the main causes of traffic accidents. The existing researches have been conducted to predict the collisions. Learning-based methods are proposed to solve this complicated issue, which the traditional methods are difficult to solve. However, due to some limitations in terms of the feature extraction and prediction performance, back-propagation learning methods are facing challenge. In this paper, we proposed a novel Rear-end Collision Prediction Mechanism with deep learning method (RCPM), in which a convolutional neural network model is established. In RCPM, the dataset is smoothed and expanded based on genetic theory to alleviate the class imbalance problem. The preprocessed dataset is divided into training and testing sets as the input to train our convolutional neural network model. The experimental results show that compared with the Honda, Berkeley and multi-layer perception neural-network-based algorithms, RCPM effectively improves performance to predict rear-end collisions. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Manuscript received March 11, 2020; revised May 14, 2020; accepted June 8, 2020.

Mobility and crowdsensing have emerged as a new means to investigate the ambient air quality in urban areas. However, the design of the network (e.g., number of sensors per unit area) and the scientific interpretation of collected data with an ad hoc method are still challenging. In this paper, we focus on the use of a fleet of private bicycles to monitor NO<inf>2</inf> concentrations in the city of Marseille, France. The study is based on synthetic observations generated by means of a regional air quality simulation system at a spatial resolution of 25 m x 25 m and simulated bike trips that are randomly generated in the city. The bike trips correspond to a maximum of 4500 bike commuters and are generated using a web-based navigation service. Simulated bike tracks are validated using available statistics on bike counts. Each bike track is associated with the along-track corresponding NO<inf>2</inf> concentrations collected from the air quality simulations and physical features on the ground collected from Open Street Map. Spatialization of the information collected aboard the bikes is tested by using three different algorithms: kriging, land-use regression (LUR) and neural network (NN). LUR and NN show that the fleet can be limited to below 100 bikes while the performance of kriging is steadily increasing with the number of bikes. Increasing the sample distance above 200 m also impairs the citywide prediction of simulated NO<inf>2</inf> concentrations. © 2020 by the authors.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092394091,Yes,France,Environment,Air Quality,Urban Development & Land Use,"Machine Learning, Statistical Methods, Mobile Sensing",Prediction/Forecasting,Compare statistical methods for urban-scale NO2 prediction using mobile sensors on bicycles,"SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 3 (Health), SDG 13 (Climate)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

In this work we forecast the crowd density and distribution in an urban area by analyzing an aggregated mobile phone dataset. By comparing the forecasting performance of statistical and deep learning methods on the aggregated mobile data we show that each class of methods has its advantages and disadvantages depending on the forecasting scenario. However, for our time-series forecasting problem, deep learning methods are preferable when it comes to simplicity and immediacy of use, since they do not require a time-consuming model selection for each different cell. Deep learning approaches are also appropriate when aiming to reduce the maximum forecasting error. Statistical methods instead show their superiority in providing more precise forecasting results, but they require data domain knowledge and computationally expensive techniques in order to select the best parameters. © 2020 by the authors.",Funding text 1: Funding: Work supported by the POR-FESR 2014-2020 Project: POLIcy Support systEm for smart city data governancE-POLIS-EYE.

Mobile cloud computing (MCC) is an effective way to alleviate the limitation of computation capacity by offloading complex tasks from mobile devices (MDs) to central clouds. Besides, mobile-edge computing (MEC) is a promising technology to reduce latency during data transmission and save energy by providing services in a timely manner. However, it is still difficult to solve the task offloading challenges in heterogeneous cloud computing environments, where edge clouds and central clouds work collaboratively to satisfy the requirements of city IoT applications. In this article, we consider the heterogeneity of edge and central cloud servers in the offloading destination selection. To jointly optimize the system utility and the bandwidth allocation for each MD, we establish a hybrid offloading model, including the collaboration of MCC and MEC. A distributed deep learning-driven task offloading (DDTO) algorithm is proposed to generate near-optimal offloading decisions over the MDs, edge cloud server, and central cloud server. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy of the DDTO algorithm, which can effectively and efficiently generate near-optimal offloading decisions in the edge and cloud computing environments. Furthermore, it achieves high performance and greatly reduces the computational complexity when compared with other offloading schemes that neglect the collaboration of heterogeneous clouds. More precisely, the DDTO scheme can improve computational performance by 63%, compared with the local-only scheme. © 2014 IEEE.","Manuscript received February 29, 2020; revised April 25, 2020; accepted May 19, 2020.

Our system employs IoT devices mounted on vehicles as well as static reference stations to measure a variety of city parameters, such as humidity, temperature, and air pollution. Mobile measurements cover a larger area compared to static stations; however, there is a tradeoff between temporal and spatial resolution. We address this problem as a matrix completion on graphs problem and rely on variational graph autoencoders to propose a deep learning solution for the estimation of the unknown air pollution values. Our model is extended to capture the correlation among different air pollutants, leading to improved estimation. We conduct experiments at different spatial and temporal resolution and compare with state-of-the-art methods to show the efficiency of our approach.

More exactly, we estimated the income per capita by help of a machine learning model for 46 cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants, based on the National Polar-orbiting Partnership-Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) nighttime satellite images from 2012-2018. For the automation of calculation, a new ModelBuilder type tool was developed within the ArcGIS software called EO-Incity (Earth Observation-Income city). The sum of light (SOL) data extracted by means of the EO-Incity tool and the observed income data were integrated in an algorithm within the MATLAB software in order to calculate a transfer equation and the average error. The results achieved were subsequently reintegrated in EO-Incity and used for the estimation of the income value at local level. The regression analyses highlighted a stable and strong relationship between SOL and income for the analyzed cities. The EO-Incity tool and the machine learning model proved to be efficient in the real-time estimation of the income at local level. When integrated in the information systems specific for smart cities, the y can serve as a support for decision-making in order to fight poverty and reduce social inequalities. © 2020 by the authors.","Funding: This work was supported by a grant of Ministry of Research and Innovation, CNCS-UEFISCDI, project number PN-III-P4-ID-PCCF-2016-0084, within PNCDI III.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85091865072,Yes,Romania,Social Equity,Economic Analysis,Urban Development & Land Use,"Machine Learning, Earth Observation, GIS",Prediction/Forecasting,Develop ML model for real-time income estimation at local level using nighttime satellite images,"SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 1 (Poverty)",Empirical,Quantitative,Regional,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

There is a need for ultra-low latency, reliable service along with security and privacy. Fog Computing is a promising solution to overcome these challenges. The originality, scope and novelty of this paper is the definition and formulation of the problem of smart neighborhoods in context of smart grids. This is achieved through an extensive literature study, firstly on Fog Computing and its foundation technologies, its applications and the literature review of Fog Computing research in various application domains.

Transportation, power delivery, environmental monitoring, and medical applications are among the front runners when it comes to leveraging the benefits of IoT for improving services through modern decision support systems. Though with the enormous usage of the Internet of Medical Things, security and privacy become intrinsic issues, thus adversaries can exploit these devices or information on these devices for malicious intents. These devices generate and log large and complex raw data which are used by decision support systems to provide better care to patients. Investigation of these enormous and complicated data from a victim's device is a daunting and time-consuming task for an investigator. Different feature-based frameworks have been proposed to resolve this problem to detect early and effectively the access logs to better assess the event. But the problem with the existing approaches is that it forces the investigator to manually comb through collected data which can contain a huge amount of irrelevant data. These data are provided normally in textual form to the investigators which are too time-consuming for the investigations even if they can utilize machine learning or natural language processing techniques. In this paper, we proposed a visualization-based approach to tackle the problem of investigating large and complex raw data sets from the Internet of Medical Things. Our contribution in this work is twofold. Firstly, we create a data set through a dynamic behavioral analysis of 400 malware samples. Secondly, the resultant and reduced data set were then visualized most feasibly. This is to investigate an incident easily. The experimental results show that an investigator can investigate large amounts of data in an easy and time-efficient manner through the effective use of visualization techniques. © 2020 by the authors.","Funding text 1: Acknowledgments: This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2019R1F1A1042721).

Creating a precise simulation for future land change is a challenging process that requires temporal and spatial modeling. Many recent studies developed and trained models to predict urban expansion patterns using Artificial Intelligence (AI). This study aims to enhance the simulation capability of Cellular Automata Markov Chain (CA-MC) model in predicting changes in land-use. This study integrates the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) into CA-MC to incorporate several driving forces that highly impact land-use change. The research utilizes different socio-economic, spatial, and environmental variables (slope, distance to road, distance to urban centers, distance to commercial, density, elevation, and land fertility) to generate potential transition maps using ANN Data-driven model. The generated maps are fed to CA-MC as additional inputs. We calibrated the original CA-MC and our models for 2015 cross-comparing simulated maps and actual maps obtained for Irbid city, Jordan in 2015. Validation of our model was assessed and compared to the CA-MC model using Kappa indices including the agreement in terms of quantity and location. The results elucidated that our model with an accuracy of 90.04% substantially outperforms CA-MC (86.29%) model. The improvement we obtained from integrating ANN with CA-MC suggested that the influence imposed by the driving force was necessary to be taken into account for more accurate prediction. In addition to the improved model prediction, the predicted maps of Irbid for the years 2021 and 2027 will guide local authorities in the development of management strategies that balance urban expansion and protect agricultural regions.

In the last few years, driven by the increased availability of geo-referenced data from social media, embedded sensors, and remote sensing images, various techniques have become popular for land use analysis. In this paper, we first highlight and discuss the different data types and methods usually adopted in this context, as well as their purposes. Then, based on a systematic state-of-the-art study, we focused on exploring the potential of points of interest (POIs) for land use classification, as one of the most common categories of crowdsourced data. We developed an application to automatically collect POIs for the study area, creating a dataset that was used to generate a large number of features. We used a ranking technique to select, among them, the most suitable features for classifying land use. As ground truth data, we used CORINE Land Cover (CLC), which is a solid and reliable dataset available for the whole European territory. It uses an artificial neural network (ANN) in different scenarios and our results reveal values of more than 90% for the accuracy and F-score in one experiment performed. Our analysis suggests that POI data have promising potential to characterize geographic spaces. The work described here aims to provide an alternative to the current methodologies for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, which are usually time-consuming and depend on expensive data types. © 2020 by the authors.

Statistical prediction methods and machine learning methods have some defects in landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), meanwhile, hybrid methods have been developed by combining the statistical prediction methods with machine learning methods in recent years, and some of them were reported to perform better than conventional methods. In view of this, the principal component analysis (PCA) method was used to extract the susceptibility evaluation indexes of HLDs; the particle swarm optimization-support vector machine (PSO-SVM) model and genetic algorithm-support vector machine (GA-SVM) model were implemented to the susceptibility mapping and zoning of HLDs in China. The research results show that the accumulative contribution rate of the four principal components is 92.050%; evaluation results of the PSO-SVM model are better than those of the GA-SVM model; micro dangerous areas, moderate dangerous areas, severe dangerous areas and extreme dangerous areas account for 24.24%, 19.49%, 36.53% and 19.74% of the total areas of China; among the 1543 disaster points in the HLDs inventory, there are 134, 182, 421 and 806 located in the above areas respectively. © 2020 Yin et al.

The development of highly accurate machine learning models is yet harder when considering the optimization of hyperparameters, which is an expensive computational task. To tackle these challenges this work proposes the Distributed Evolutionary Hyperparameter Optimization (DEHO) for the Weighted Multivariate Fuzzy Time Series method (WMVFTS), a simple and non-parametric forecasting method with high scalability and accuracy, comprising a sequential training and forecasting procedure and a MapReduce extension for distributed processing. The proposed methods were evaluated using a cluster with commodity hardware and two big time series, showing increasing speed up for training and test times as new CPU cores are added to cluster. Then the DEHO method was executed in the computational cluster, achieving fast convergence and feasible processing time and generating highly accurate WMVFTS models. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","ACKNOWLEDGMENT Petrônio C.

Neighborhood environments may structure risks and resources that produce COVID-19 disparities. Neighborhood built environments that allow greater flow of people into an area or impede social distancing practices may increase residents’ risk for contracting the virus. We leveraged Google Street View (GSV) images and computer vision to detect built environment features (presence of a crosswalk, non-single family home, single-lane roads, dilapidated building and visible wires). We utilized Poisson regression models to determine associations of built environment characteristics with COVID-19 cases. Indicators of mixed land use (non-single family home), walkability (sidewalks), and physical disorder (dilapidated buildings and visible wires) were connected with higher COVID-19 cases. Indicators of lower urban development (single lane roads and green streets) were connected with fewer COVID-19 cases. Percent black and percent with less than a high school education were associated with more COVID-19 cases. Our findings suggest that built environment characteristics can help characterize community-level COVID-19 risk. Sociodemographic disparities also highlight differential COVID-19 risk across groups of people. Computer vision and big data image sources make national studies of built environment effects on COVID-19 risk possible, to inform local area decision-making. © 2020 by the authors.

The visual qualities and spatial distribution of architecture represent the image of a city, which affects the psychological states of the residents and can induce positive or negative social outcomes. Hence, it is important to study the visual perception of Chinese traditional-style buildings in China. Previous works have been restricted by the lack of data sources and techniques, which were not quantitative and comprehensive. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning model for automatically predicting the presence of Chinese traditional-style buildings and developed two view indicators to quantify the pedestrians' visual perceptions of buildings. Using this model, Chinese traditional-style buildings were automatically segmented in streetscape images within the Fifth Ring Road of Beijing and then the perception of Chinese traditional-style buildings was quantified with two view indictors. This model can also help to automatically predict the perception of Chinese traditional-style buildings for new urban regions in China, and more importantly, the two view indicators provide a new quantitative method for measuring the urban visual perception in street level, which is of great significance for the quantitative research of tourism route and urban planning. © 2020 by the authors.","Funding text 1: This research was founded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 41525004, 41421001, and 41877523, and supported by a grant from the State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System, and the Science Foundation of China University of Petroleum, Beijing, Grant No. ZX20200100.

They are usually unpredictable, fast in development and extend across large geographical areas. The consequences of such disasters can be reduced through better monitoring, for example using mobile sensing platforms that can give timely and accurate information to first responders and the public. Given the extended scale of the areas to monitor, and the time-varying nature of the phenomenon, we need fast algorithms to quickly determine the best sequence of locations to be monitored. This problem is very challenging: the present informative mobile sensor routing algorithms are either short-sighted or computationally demanding when applied to large scale systems. In this paper, a real-time sensor task scheduling algorithm that suits the features and needs of city-scale environmental monitoring tasks is proposed. The algorithm is run in forward search and makes use of the predictions of an associated distributed parameter system, modeling flash flood propagation. It partly inherits the causal relation expressed by a search tree, which describes all possible sequential decisions. The computationally heavy data assimilation steps in the forward search tree are replaced by functions dependent on the covariance matrix between observation sets. Taking flood tracking in an urban area as a concrete example, numerical experiments in this paper indicate that this scheduling algorithm can achieve better results than myopic planning algorithms and other heuristics based sensor placement algorithms. Furthermore, this paper relies on a deep learning-based data-driven model to track the system states, and experiments suggest that popular estimation techniques have very good performance when applied to precise data-driven models.

It is foreseeable that hybrid operations of human driving vehicles and automated vehicles in the urban transportation environment will be a long-standing state. To investigate the influence of AVs on the hybrid ride-hailing market, data-driven agent-based modeling and simulation (D2ABMS) for large-scale transportation networks is proposed, in which human drivers, automated vehicles, and passengers form three types of agents. D2ABMS goes beyond existing approaches by employing data-driven multi-objective deep learning to learn ride-sourcing drivers' offline/online behavior. E mbedding is used to represent the hidden attributes of different classes of drivers. Ride-sourcing data collected from the city of Hangzhou, China, are used to train and validate the drivers' decision-making model. Hybrid operations of human driving vehicles and automated vehicles with D2ABMS are comprehensively tested in various scenarios. The results show that a small proportion of automated vehicles in the hybrid ride-hailing market can significantly reduce the average waiting time of passengers. Besides, compared to the human driving scenario, the total exhaust emissions and vehicle kilometers traveled can be reduced by 12.3% in the AVs scenario. The proposed D2ABMS system has the potential to help transportation planners and ride-hailing platforms to assess their policies and operations management strategies in the era of shared mobility and automated vehicles. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Funding text 1: This research is financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China ( 2018YFB1600900 ), Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China ( LR17E080002 ), National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 71771198 , 71922019 ), and joint project of National Natural Science Foundation of China and Joint Programming Initiative Urban Europe (NSFC – JPI UE) ('U-PASS', 71961137005 ).; Funding text 2: This research is financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFB1600900), Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (LR17E080002), National Natural Science Foundation of China (71771198, 71922019), and joint project of National Natural Science Foundation of China and Joint Programming Initiative Urban Europe (NSFC ?

This paper is along this line of thought. In particular, we try to present a method to model the cognitive state of human interest. This is done to take one more step towards the realization of a smart cognitive city. An approach which is Subjective–Objective in nature is presented to model the computation of activity inspired by interest. Based on activity, human latent state values are indirectly deduced. Inspiration is drawn from Physics and interest is modeled upon the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process.

In the past, traffic data were usually acquired and disseminated by government agencies through fixed-location sensors. High costs, infrastructure demands, and low coverage levels of these sensor devices require agencies and researchers to look beyond the traditional approaches. With the emergence of smartphones and navigation apps, location-based and crowdsourced Big Data are receiving increased attention. In this regard, location-based big data (LocBigData) collected from probe vehicles and road users can be used to provide speed and travel time information in different locations. Examining the quality of crowdsourced data is essential for researchers and agencies before using them. This study assessed the quality of Waze speed data from surface streets and conducted a case study in Sevierville, Tennessee. Typically, examining the quality of these data in surface streets and arterials is more challenging than freeways data. This research used Bluetooth speed data as the ground truth, which is independent of Waze data. In this study, three steps of methodology were used. In the first step, Waze speed data was compared to Bluetooth data in terms of accuracy, mean difference, and distribution similarity. In the second step, a k-means algorithm was used to categorize Waze data quality, and a multinomial logistics regression model was performed to explore the significant factors that impact data quality. Finally, in the third step, machine learning techniques were conducted to predict the data quality in different conditions. The result of the comparison showed a similar pattern and a slight difference between datasets, which verified the quality of Waze speed data. The statistical model indicates that that Waze speed data are more accurate in peak hours than in night hours. Also, the traffic speed, traffic volume, and segment length have a significant association on the accuracy of Waze data on surface streets. Finally, the result of machine learning prediction showed that a KNN method performed the highest prediction accuracy of 84.5% and 82.9% of the time for training and test datasets, respectively. Overall, the study results suggest that Waze speed data is a promising data source for surface streets. © 2020","This research received support from Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT).

Building smart cities is also a long-term task for China to promote new-type urbanization and healthy urban development. Nowadays, China's new urbanization takes wisdom, intelligence and green ecology as the core theory, and an increasing cities have joined the planning and construction of green ecology, intelligent and intelligent urbanization. Landscape pattern optimization is one of the important ways in achieving regional ecological security. With the rapid development of urbanization, the ecological space has been continuously compressed. How to coordinate the contradiction between regional ecological security and social and economic development has become the main problem facing China's land use. In this study, GLP-ESA-ACO coupling model is used to optimize the allocation of landscape pattern under the goal of ecological security and economic coordination, and Jinzhou-Huludao coastal area is taken as an example for empirical research. Maximizing comprehensive benefits is taken as the objective of optimizing landscape pattern allocation, and GLP is applied to quantitatively constrain landscape types from three aspects of ecological security, ecological service function and social and economic development. Based on the ecological suitability assessment of construction land, considering the change rule of landscape pattern characteristics and the ecological service value of each land type, the appropriate land use distribution map is determined as the spatial constraint of landscape pattern optimization. Using ant colony optimization algorithm, under the constraints of quantity and space, and under the guidance of ecological protection, the optimization sequence is determined, and the optimal allocation results of various landscape types are obtained and superimposed to obtain the final optimal allocation map of landscape pattern in Jinzhou-Huludao coastal area. The results show that: (1) The optimal plan meets the land use indicators of actual planning, takes the maximization of comprehensive benefits as the goal, strictly controls the development and construction of ecological sensitive areas along the coastline, and is superior to the urban planning of destroying the ecological coastal zone tidal flat wetland through reclamation; (2) In the optimal plan, the grassland in the northwest mountain area of Jinhu coastal area is converted into forest, which is consistent with the actual situation in the coastal area of Jinzhou-Huludao in 2020, and the hot spots of inland urban construction in the optimal plan are basically consistent with the actual situation.

This network of connections is referred to as an interface network. Investigation of interface network connectivity can help understand and minimize failure propagation from water to transportation systems. Water distribution-transportation interface networks consist of nodes, which can be either pipes or roads, and edges, which represent the geospatial colocation of a pipe and road. The purpose of this study is twofold: to topologically represent geospatial colocation by characterizing the connectivity of water distribution-transportation interface networks for multiple cities, and to identify the nodal attributes that are most predictive of a given connectivity profile. A total of forty interface networks from eight cities of varying geospatial morphology are extracted and analyzed using network analysis and machine learning. Using network analysis, we investigate whether the topological connectivity between water and transportation is consistent across different cities. Then we use a random forest model to ascertain which nodal attributes may have predictive power to identify the connectivity cluster of the city to which a node belongs. The results indicate that cities of different geospatial morphology may vary in their interface network connectivity, and the average shortest path length of a given node is the major nodal feature contributing to a given city's interface network connectivity.

The use of convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based image demosaicking and denoising methods has been very successful. However, still there is a room for improvement in the network performance in terms of efficiency and accuracy. The main challenge that remains to be addressed is to guarantee the visual quality of reconstructed images, particularly in the presence of noise. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel demosaicking and denoising conjunct strategy using deep adaptive residual learning. The proposed framework has three stages. Initially, zero padding is performed to increase processing speed and preserve the edges of the image. In the second phase, we perform demosaicking using interpolation in order to find missing values using information about neighboring pixels. Finally, the reconstructed image is created using the original image. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed scheme, we used Pytorch and Google Colab with 400 images for training and 100 images for validation The outcomes show that the proposed scheme beats cutting edge joint demosaicking and denoising schemes regarding both structural similarity index metrics (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and basic similitude record measurements (SSIM). © 2020","This work is supported by BK21 Plus project (SW Human Resource Development Program for Supporting Smart Life) funded by the Ministry of Education, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Korea (21A20131600005).

A relevant difference between developed and emerging economies is the reduced access to home charging in emerging economies, which is the case in Latin American cities. Thus, developing public charging stations represents a crucial factor in the mass adoption of EVs by road commuters. We develop herein a methodology for optimizing the deployment of smart charging stations under the sprawling phenomenon perspective. Our method comprises two steps. In step one, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) to facilitate the analysis of a sprawling city, and then we define candidates for potential locations from ‘demand clusters’ within an urbanized area, by K-means clustering analysis. In the second step, a stochastic programming model was employed to optimize the integration of infrastructural facilities with distributed energy resources (DERs) and EV charging stations using a collaborative strategy to minimize its energy consumption cost under demand uncertainty. We demonstrate the capabilities of this approach through a case study in the city of Lima.

Hence, cold-air paths are an important mitigation aspect in urban planning. The identification of cold-air paths by field measurements, however, is time-consuming and it is difficult to cover larger spatial domains (e.g. entire cities). Therefore, we used a machine learning technique, boosted regression trees (BRT), for estimating the spatial distribution of cold-air paths in three German cities (Braunschweig, Freiburg, Stuttgart). We identified the most important predictor variables for cold-air path occurrence and tested the spatial transferability of BRT models from one training city to the other study cities. Three variables explaining differences in surface elevation indicated strongest influence on spatial distribution of cold-air paths: relative surface elevation, topographic position index, and topographic wind index. We achieved predictions for the spatial distribution of cold-air paths for cities the model was trained on, resulting in model performances of 0.85 < AUC < 0.96 (AUC: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve). Model transfers to other cities, however, achieved only poor to moderate results (0.5 < AUC < 0.8).

Transfer works best for ‘similar’ cities, i.e. cities with a comparable range of predictor variables and morphological structure.

We propose a crowd counting algorithm based on deep regression forest, named CountForest. First of all, according to the correlation among frames, the crowd counting problem is transformed into a label-distribution-learning problem. Then we combine convolutional neural networks(CNN) and deep regression forest to make a hybrid model. CNN is introduced for the task of feature learning and deep decision forest is extended to address label distribution learning problem in crowd counting. Thereinto, the proposed network replaces its softmax layer with the aforementioned probabilistic decision forest in order to better establish a mapping relationship between image features and crowds’ number so as to implement an end-to-end hybrid model for crowd counting problem. Our method demonstrated in the final experiments not only attains the high accuracy in crowd counting but has comparable robustness and instantaneity in selected public datasets as well. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","This work was supported by Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China (No.2016A030313288).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082964950,Yes,China,Public Safety and Security,Urban Services,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Deep Regression Forest",Object Detection/Counting,Propose a crowd counting algorithm combining CNNs and deep regression forests for smart city video surveillance,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

With the increasing industrialization in IoT, an excessive amount of sensing data is producing from various sensors devices in the Industrial IoT. To analyzes of big data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a significant role as a strong analytic tool and delivers a scalable and accurate analysis of data in real-time. However, the design and development of a useful big data analysis tool using AI have some challenges, such as centralized architecture, security, and privacy, resource constraints, lack of enough training data. Conversely, as an emerging technology, Blockchain supports a decentralized architecture. It provides a secure sharing of data and resources to the various nodes of the IoT network is encouraged to remove centralized control and can overcome the existing challenges in AI. The main goal of our research is to design and develop an IoT architecture with blockchain and AI to support an effective big data analysis. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-enabled Intelligent IoT Architecture with Artificial Intelligence that provides an efficient way of converging blockchain and AI for IoT with current state-of-the-art techniques and applications. We evaluate the proposed architecture and categorized into two parts: qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis. In qualitative evaluation, we describe how to use AI and Blockchain in IoT applications with “AI-driven Blockchain” and “Blockchain-driven AI.” In quantitative analysis, we present a performance evaluation of the BlockIoTIntelligence architecture to compare existing researches on device, fog, edge and cloud intelligence according to some parameters such as accuracy, latency, security and privacy, computational complexity and energy cost in IoT applications.

Whilst government and corporations are focusing on their need to facilitate data sharing, the perspective of many individuals is that too much data is being shared. The issue is not only about data, but about power. The individual does not often have a voice when issues relating to data sharing are tackled. Regulators can cite the ‘public interest’ when data governance is discussed, but the individual’s interests may diverge from that of the public. This paper considers the data subject's position with respect to data collection leading to considerations about surveillance and datafication. Proposals for data trusts will be considered applying principles of English trust law to possibly mitigate the imbalance of power between large data users and individual data subjects. Finally, the possibility of a workable remedy in the form of a class action lawsuit which could give the data subjects some collective power in the event of a data breach will be explored.

It also helps the government to assist disaster assessments and land use planning, manage the distribution of population and resource, and promote urban sustainable development. However, existing population spatialization methods are insufficient to spatialize population in cities and towns at fine scales. With the rapid development of geospatial big data and the popularity of high-resolution remote sensing data, this study proposes a method to estimate urban population distribution at fine scales through fusing multi-source spatial data. First, a total of 12 variables having large correlations (R²>0.7) with the population were selected to estimate the population distribution in Ningbo city, including the build-up area, distance to the road, nighttime lights, business service center, EAHSI index, kindergarten, park, primary school, gas station, hospital, and bus station and coach station. First, the population distribution areas are determined by urban functional zones, then a random forest model was used to train a population estimation model with the selected 12 variables; finally, the 2018 population data of the Ningbo were redistributed into 500 m grids by the trained estimation model. The importance of the chosen variables were analyzed using the random forest model. The results demonstrate that the presented population estimation model reaches an accuracy of 81.2% at sub-district scale with the MRE of 0.29 and the RMSE of 3279.89. Therefore, the population estimation model presented in this study can accurately predict the population distribution at the sub-district. This study also conducted the accuracy verification at the grid scale with the MRE of 17.16 and the RMSE of 1149.9. According to the importance of variables computed by the random forest model, it is found that the importance of the variable building area is about 0.22, which has the largest influence on the population distribution, followed by the variables, distance to road, nighttime lights, business service center, EAHSI ( Elevation-Adjusted Human Settlement Index), kindergarten, and park. The accuracy verification at the grid level is of great significance for studying the fine population distribution in cities. However, the estimation accuracy is still not very high in some cases where the populations of some grids are either overestimated or underestimated. The lack of building height information is a possible reason. In addition, deep learning methods will be explored to improve accuracy in future. © 2020, Science Press.

Limited local data are a barrier to the formulation and evaluation of policies to reduce air and noise pollution. Methods and analysis We designed a year-long measurement campaign to characterise air and noise pollution and their sources at high-resolution within the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA), Ghana. Our design uses a combination of fixed (year-long, n=10) and rotating (week-long, n =∼130) sites, selected to represent a range of land uses and source influences (eg, background, road traffic, commercial, industrial and residential areas, and various neighbourhood socioeconomic classes). We will collect data on fine particulate matter (PM 2.5), nitrogen oxides (NO x), weather variables, sound (noise level and audio) along with street-level time-lapse images. We deploy low-cost, low-power, lightweight monitoring devices that are robust, socially unobtrusive, and able to function in Sub-Saharan African (SSA) climate. We will use state-of-the-art methods, including spatial statistics, deep/machine learning, and processed-based emissions modelling, to capture highly resolved temporal and spatial variations in pollution levels across the GAMA and to identify their potential sources. This protocol can serve as a prototype for other SSA cities. Ethics and dissemination This environmental study was deemed exempt from full ethics review at Imperial College London and the University of Massachusetts Amherst; it was approved by the University of Ghana Ethics Committee (ECH 149/18-19). This protocol is designed to be implementable in SSA cities to map environmental pollution to inform urban planning decisions to reduce health harming exposures to air and noise pollution. It will be disseminated through local stakeholder engagement (public and private sectors), peer-reviewed publications, contribution to policy documents, media, and conference presentations. ©",Funding This work is supported by the Pathways to Equitable Healthy Cities grant from the Wellcome Trust (209376/Z/17/Z).

It provides unprecedented opportunities to analyze and derive valuable insights of urban dynamics, specifically, time-dependent mobility patterns and region-specific travel demands. This work proposes an end-to-end mobility association rule mining framework called MARIO, conducive to extract urban mobility dynamics through analysing large taxi trip traces of a city. The MARIO framework consists of (i) generating mobility-dynamics network by spatio-temporal analysis of taxi-trips, (ii) finding travel demand variations in different functional regions of the urban area, (iii) extracting mobility association rules and (iv) predicting travel demands and traffic dynamics using extracted associative rules. The proposed MARIO framework is implemented in Google Cloud Platform and an extensive set of experiments using real GPS trace dataset of NYC Green and Yellow Taxi trace, Roma Taxi Dataset and San Francisco Taxi Dataset have been carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework.

One of the core functions of a smart city consists in the continuous monitoring of events, assets and people and the use of this information and intelligence for the streamlining of the city's operations. Public opinion represents one type of intelligence of particular importance and value. By monitoring public opinion, governments seek to understand prevalent views about the current events and policies, as well as identify extreme views and trends that may represent problematic situations or precursors to violent actions. Ultimately, maintaining a constant awareness of public opinion means that authorities can better assess and predict public reactions in relation to ongoing events, and thus take appropriate actions to maintain public safety. Due to the popular use of social media to express sentiments and emotions about current events, social media content analysis has been contemplated as a promising solution to capture public opinion. However, existing approaches take a coarse-grained retrospective approach to social media content analysis. Furthermore, those approaches suffer from the lack of scalability and efficiency, as they necessitate the collection and analysis of large volumes of social media content (often millions of posts), to come up with relevant conclusions. In this work, we address those limitations by proposing a novel framework for the real-time monitoring of public opinion. To ensure efficiency and scalability, our framework focuses on the analysis of high impact social media content generated by opinion leaders and their followers as means to offer in-depth insights and sentiment intelligence reports about events, as they are occurring in real time. The proposed framework was implemented and tested on data harvested from 52 economic opinion leaders, with a focus on the China-US trade war as case study. The results show that the convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier used for sentiment analysis yielded a classification accuracy of 86% when differentiating between four sentiment categories: Support, strong support, dissent, and strong dissent. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier employed to perform in-depth emotional analysis attained an accuracy of 82% when differentiating between five emotions: Angry, depressed, excited, happy, and worried. Unlike existing retrospective social media analysis approaches that require the analysis of millions of posts, our approach focuses on the analysis of high-impact social media content in real-time, thus constituting an efficient, sustainable, and timely solution to public opinion monitoring. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084032594,Yes,United Arab Emirates,Social Media Analysis,Urban Governance,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Sentiment Analysis,Classification,Develop a sentiment reporting framework for monitoring major city events in smart cities using case study on trade war,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

An accurate predictive model can help individuals make reliable travel plans and choose optimal routes while efficiently helping administrators maintain traffic order. Road speed prediction, which is a sub-task of traffic flow forecasting, is challenging due to the complicated spatial dependencies characterizing road networks and dynamic temporal traffic patterns. Given the power of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in learning temporal relations and graph neural networks (GNNs) in integrating graph-structured and node-attributed features, in this paper, we design a novel graph LSTM (GLSTM) framework to capture spatial-temporal representations in road speed forecasting. More specifically, we first present a temporal directed attributed graph to model complex traffic flow. Then, to take advantage of the structure properties and graph features, we employ a message-passing mechanism for feature aggregation and updating. Finally, we further implement several variants of LSTMs with a GN block under the encoder-decoder framework to model spatial-temporal dependencies. The experiments show that our proposed model is able to fully utilize both the road latent graph structure and traffic speed to forecast the road state during future periods. The results on two real-world datasets show that our GLSTM can outperform state-of-the-art baseline methods by up to 32.8% in terms of MAE, 43.2% in terms of MAPE and 23.1% in terms of RMSE. © 2020","The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments on this research work.

This is due to cities’ attention in supporting smart and sustainable urbanism practices. In an era of digitalization of urban services and processes, which is upon us, platform urbanism is becoming a fundamental tool to support smart urban governance, and helping in the formation of a new version of cities—i.e., City 4.0. This new version utilizes urban dashboards and platforms in its operations and management tasks of its complex urban metabolism. These intelligent systems help in maintaining the robustness of our cities, integrating various sensors (e.g., internet-of-things) and big data analysis technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence) with the aim of optimizing urban infrastructures and services (e.g., water, waste, energy), and turning the urban system into a smart one. The study generates insights from the sensor city best practices by placing some of renowned projects, implemented by Huawei, Cisco, Google, Ericsson, Microsoft, and Alibaba, under the microscope. The investigation findings reveal that the sensor city approach: (a) Has the potential to increase the smartness and sustainability level of cities; (b) Manages to engage citizens and companies in the process of planning, monitoring and analyzing urban processes; (c) Raises awareness on the local environmental, social and economic issues, and; (d) Provides a novel city blueprint for urban administrators, managers and planners. Nonetheless, the use of advanced technologies—e.g., real-time monitoring stations, cloud computing, surveillance cameras—poses a multitude of challenges related to: (a) Quality of the data used; (b) Level of protection of traditional and cybernetic urban security; (c) Necessary integration between the various urban infrastructure, and; (d) Ability to transform feedback from stakeholders into innovative urban policies. © 2020 by the authors.

A landslide factor database was established with 12 influencing factors including elevation, slope, aspect, landform type, geological lithology, soil type, soil erosion, rainfall, water system, land use, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and population density. A neural network model was used to analyze driving factors of spatial distribution characteristics of landslide disasters and quantitatively calculate the contribution weight of each influencing factor. The accuracy of the model was evaluated with the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The results obtained from the nearest neighbor index analysis show that the historical landslide disaster points in the study area are clustered, and the spatial hotspot detection and kernel density estimation indicate that Yuzhong District, Shapingba District, and northern Banan District are the areas where the landslides are most concentrated. Among all the factors, population density, land use and rainfall occupy the highest weight, while the weight of aspect and road are the lowest. The area value under the ROC curve (AUC) is 0.917, indicating that the model can accurately reflect the impact of landslide influencing factors in the area. © 2020, Editorial Board of Journal of Chongqing University, Chongqing University Journals Department.

Although diverse forecasting models based on artificial intelligence techniques have been proposed with good performance, they require sufficient datasets for training. In the case of monthly forecasting, because just one data point is generated per month, it is not easy to collect sufficient data to construct models. This lack of data can be alleviated using transfer learning techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel monthly electric load forecasting scheme for a city or district based on transfer learning using similar data from other cities or districts. To do this, we collected the monthly electric load data from 25 districts in Seoul for five categories and various external data, such as calendar, population, and weather data. Then, based on the available data of the target city or district, we selected similar data from the collected datasets by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient and constructed a forecasting model using the selected data. Lastly, we fine-tuned the model using the target data. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we conducted an extensive comparison with other popular machine-learning techniques through various experiments.

More recently, call detail record (CDR) of mobile phone data has been used to estimate human population distributions. However, there is a key challenge that the accuracy of such a method is difficult to validate because there is no ground truth data for the dynamic population density distribution in time scales such as hourly. In this study, we present a simple and accurate method to generate more finely grained temporal-spatial population density distributions based upon CDR data. We designed an experiment to test our method based upon the use of a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN). In this experiment, the highest spatial resolution of every grid cell is 125 x 125 square metre, while the temporal resolution can vary from minutes to hours with varying accuracy. To demonstrate our method, we present an application of how to map the estimated population density distribution dynamically for CDR big data from Beijing, choosing a half hour as the temporal resolution. Finally, in order to cross-check previous studies that claim the population distribution at nighttime (from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. on the next day) mapped by Beijing census data are similar to the ground truth data, we estimated the baseline distribution, first, based upon records in CDRs. Second, we estimate a baseline distribution based upon Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data.

As an anticipated aspect of smart transportation, bike-sharing systems have recently been deployed in many cities and are considered an efficient way to address the issue of 'the last mile.' In a bike-sharing system, the supply and demand of shared bikes at each bike station frequently change over time. Consequently, one of the most challenging issues of a bike-sharing system is predicting the required number of shared bikes at each station. In this article, we take the real aspects of a bike-sharing system into account, e.g., the high complexity, nonlinearity, and uncertainty of the traffic flow, and propose a hybrid edge-computing-based machine learning model. Notably, our proposed model, which combines a self-organizing mapping network with a regression tree (RT), is applied to predict the bicycle demand of a certain station through the following steps: 1) the proposed model adopts self-organization mapping to assemble the original samples in the form of clusters and 2) each cluster is then built as an RT to forecast the required number of bikes at each station. Experiments based on real data from the Washington and London bike-sharing systems show that our proposed method achieves a higher prediction accuracy and better generalization than previous approaches. © 2014 IEEE.","Manuscript received September 20, 2019; revised January 23, 2020 and February 13, 2020; accepted March 19, 2020.

However, traditional ways of measuring urban shrinkage are focused on tracking population loss at the city level and are unable to capture the spatially heterogeneous shrinking patterns inside a city. Consequently, the spatial mechanism and patterns of urban shrinkage inside a city remain less understood, which is unhelpful for developing accommodation strategies for shrinkage. The smart city initiatives and practices have provided a rich pool of geospatial big data resources and technologies to tackle the complexity of urban systems. Given this context, we propose a new measure for the delineation of shrinking areas within cities by introducing a new concept of functional urban shrinkage, which aims to capture the mismatch between urban built-up areas and the areas where significantly intensive human activities take place. Taking advantage of a data fusion approach to integrating multi-source geospatial big data and survey data, a general analytical framework is developed to construct functional shrinkage measures. Specifically, Landsat-8 remote sensing images were used for extracting urban built-up areas by supervised neural network classifications and Geographic Information System tools, while cellular signaling data from China Unicom Inc. was used to depict human activity areas generated by spatial clustering methods. Combining geospatial big data with urban land-use functions obtained from land surveys and Points-Of-Interests data, the framework further enables the comparison between cities from dimensions characterized by indices of spatial and urban functional characteristics and the landscape fragmentation; thus, it has the capacity to facilitate an in-depth investigation of fundamental causes and internal mechanisms of urban shrinkage. With a case study of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei megaregion using data from various sources collected for the year of 2018, we demonstrate the validity of this approach and its potential generalizability for other spatial contexts in facilitating timely and better-informed planning decision support. © 2020 by the authors.","Funding: This research was funded by the National Key R&D Program of China, grant number 2018YFB2100701.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089841531,Yes,China,Urban Planning and Development,Urban Planning,Urban Development & Land Use,Geospatial Big Data Analysis,Measurement/Analysis,Measure functional urban shrinkage patterns with multi-source geospatial big data in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei megaregion,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Regional,Past,Longitudinal,Medium

We find that a multi-class model trained on hand-labeled pixels containing Sky, Clouds, Vegetation, Water, Building facades, Windows, Roads, Cars, and Metal structures yields an accuracy of 90-97% for three different scenes. We assess the transferability of this model by training on one scene and testing to another with significantly different illumination conditions and/or different content. This results in a significant (~45%) decrease in the model precision and recall as does training on all scenes at once and testing on the individual scenes. These results suggest that while CNNs are powerful tools for pixel-level classification of very high-resolution spectral data of urban environments, retraining between scenes may be necessary. Furthermore, we test the dependence of the model on several instrument- and data-specific parameters including reduced spectral resolution (down to 15 spectral channels) and number of available training instances. The results are strongly class-dependent; however, we find that the classification of natural materials is particularly robust, especially the Vegetation class with a precision and recall >94% for all scenes and model transfers and >90% with only a single training instance. © 2020 by the authors.",Funding: This work was supported by a James S.

Depending on citizens’ habits, service policies, and road conditions, car usage profiles are rather variable and often hardly predictable. Even within the same city, different usage trends emerge in different districts and in various time slots and weekdays. Therefore, modeling car availability in FFCS systems is particularly challenging. For these reasons, the research community has started to investigate the applicability of Machine Learning models to analyze FFCS usage data. This paper addresses the problem of predicting the short-term level of availability of the FFCS service in the short term. Specifically, it investigates the applicability of Machine Learning models to forecast the number of available car within a restricted urban area. It seeks the spatial and temporal contexts in which nonlinear ML models, trained on past usage data, are necessary to accurately predict car availability. Leveraging ML has shown to be particularly effective while considering highly dynamic urban contexts, where FFCS service usage is likely to suddenly and unexpectedly change. To tailor predictive models to the real FFCS data, we study also the influence of ML algorithm, prediction horizon, and characteristics of the neighborhood of the target area. The empirical outcomes allow us to provide system managers with practical guidelines to setup and tune ML models. © 2020 by the authors.

In several practical scenarios, IoT still faces significant challenges with reliance on human assistance and unacceptable response time for the treatment of big data. Therefore, it is very urgent to establish a new framework and algorithm to solve problems specific to this kind of fast autonomous IoT. Traditional reinforcement learning and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches have abilities of autonomous decision making, but time-consuming modeling and training procedures limit their applications. To get over this dilemma, this article proposes the broad reinforcement learning (BRL) approach that fits fast autonomous IoT as it combines the broad learning system (BLS) with a reinforcement learning paradigm to improve the agent's efficiency and accuracy of modeling and decision making. Specifically, a BRL framework is first constructed. Then, the associated learning algorithm, containing training pool introduction, training sample preparation, and incremental learning for BLS, is carefully designed. Finally, as a case study of fast autonomous IoT, the proposed BRL approach is applied to traffic light control, aiming to alleviate traffic congestion in the intersections of smart cities. The experimental results show that the proposed BRL approach can learn better action policy at a shorter execution time when compared with competing approaches. © 2014 IEEE.","Manuscript received October 1, 2019; revised January 5, 2020; accepted March 5, 2020.

As one of the basic techniques of smart cities, the task of relation extraction of named entities on social media provides an indispensable means to construct and expand knowledge map and contributes to the utilization of information resources in smart cities. What’s more, it is conducive to improve the efficiency of network supervision. This paper proposes an automatic method to extract entity relations via deep learning techniques on a two-level neural network named Bi-CLSTM. The research conquers some challenges of relation extraction on social media. To extract entity relations on conversation scenarios, Bi-CLSTM represents texts with the strategy of “word embedding + position embedding + shortest dependency path” and extracts relations via a hybrid model of LSTM and PCNN. The nodes and networks of Bi-CLSTM are designed to adapt to the scenarios of conversation and over-sentence. To reduce the dependency on training data, distant supervised strategy is employed and a two-level attention mechanism is used to prevent noise signals. Experiments are carried out on Sina Microblog corpus, and the results show that Bi-CLSTM model makes outstanding performance. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Funding text 1: This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61363028).

While this information is not globally available, it can be substituted by digital surface models (DSMs), automatically produced from inexpensive satellite imagery. However, stereo DSMs often suffer from noise and blur. Furthermore, they are heavily distorted by vegetation, which is of lesser relevance for most applications. Such basic models can be filtered by convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained on labels derived from digital elevation models (DEMs) and 3D city models, in order to obtain a refined DSM. We propose a modular multi-task learning concept that consolidates existing approaches into a generalized framework. Our encoder-decoder models with shared encoders and multiple task-specific decoders leverage roof type classification as a secondary task and multiple objectives including a conditional adversarial term. The contributing single-objective losses are automatically weighted in the final multi-task loss function based on learned uncertainty estimates. We evaluated the performance of specific instances of this family of network architectures.

There was a requirement to assess and map the urban built-up impervious areas for solving various socio-environmental issues. This work attempts to evaluate and implement machine learning (ML) based supervised classifiers to semi-automate the process for extraction, quantification and mapping of urban built-up impervious areas. The work emphasised on the usage of freely available open-source high-resolution satellite datasets acquired from Sentinel-2 mission. Three different machine learning-based supervised classification techniques were evaluated for a better understanding of feature extraction methods along with suitable classifier for classification of urban impervious areas. It is a well-known phenomenon that an increase in the impervious surface contributes to declining of green cover. Also, a zonal analysis of extracted built-up impervious surfaces was conducted to understand the spatial configuration of the pilot study area. This zonal assessment of urban built-up impervious surfaces can be used as a worthy tool for better sustainable smart cities development.

The aim of this study is to provide an overview of existing systematic reviews in this growing area of research and to synthesise the findings related to drivers, barriers and social implications of the AI adoption in business and management. The methodology used for this tertiary study is based on Kitchenham and Charter's guidelines [14], resulting in a selection of 30 reviews published between 2005 and 2019 which are reporting results of 2021 primary studies. These reviews cover the AI adoption across various business sectors (healthcare, information technology, energy, agriculture, apparel industry, engineering, smart cities, tourism and transport), management and business functions (HR, customer services, supply chain, health and safety, project management, decision-support, systems management and technology adoption). While the drivers for the AI adoption in these areas are mainly economic, the barriers are related to the technical aspects (e.g. availability of data, reusability of models) as well as the social considerations such as, increased dependence on non-humans, job security, lack of knowledge, safety, trust and lack of multiple stakeholders'perspectives. Very few reviews outside of the healthcare management domain consider human, organisational and wider societal factors of the AI adoption. In addition to increased focus on social implications of AI, the reviews are recommending more rigorous evaluation, increased use of hybrid solutions (AI and non-AI) and multidisciplinary approach to AI design and evaluation. Furthermore, this study found that there is a lack of systematic reviews in some of the early AI adoption sectors such as financial industry and retail. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085273894,No,United Kingdom,Business and Economics,Policy and Ethics,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Systematic Literature Review,Not specified,"Conduct a tertiary study on drivers, barriers and social considerations for AI adoption in business and management","SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure",Review/Survey,,,,,

Unconventional approaches to the intelligent visual data processing are proposed in order to support video surveillance operators, thus to make their work less exhaustive and more effective. Although registration of a huge amount of video data requires development of intelligent and automatic signal processing information extraction techniques, improvement of visualization methods for operators is also a very important task, because of the crucial role the human factor plays and should always play in the decision making, e.g. in the operator reactions to various crisis situations, which can never be fully eliminated by artificial intelligence. Four software based mechanisms connected with a standard or with a slightly extended hardware are proposed as options for the CCTV operators. They utilize rather known ideas but are implemented with new extensions to original algorithms, as well as with additional, innovative modifications and solutions (not presented in the literature). With them they become reliable and efficient tools for the CCTV systems. First, generation of cylindrical panoramas is suggested in order to make long-time video content analysis of a defined area easier and faster. Using panoramas it is possible to reduce the time that is required to watch the video by a factor of hundreds or even thousands and perform an efficient compression of the video stream for the long-time storage. Second, the controlled stereovision option is discussed for quicker and more precise extraction of relevant information from the observed scene. Third, the thermo-vision is analyzed for faultless detection of pedestrians at night. Finally, a novel high dynamic range (HDR) technique is proposed, dedicated to the CCTV systems, in contrast to other typical entertainment oriented HDR approaches, for clear visualization of important and meaningful image details, otherwise invisible. We validated usefulness of the proposed techniques with many experiments presented in this paper. © 2020, The Author(s).",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085146786,Yes,Poland,Public Safety and Security,Urban Services,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Intelligent Visual Data Processing,Object Detection,Develop visualization techniques for modern CCTV smart city services to support video surveillance operators,"SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities; SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

Reinforcement learning (RL) enables a single decision maker (or an agent) to learn and make optimal actions in an independent manner, while multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) enables multiple agents to exchange knowledge, learn, and make optimal joint actions in a collaborative manner. The integration of the newly emerging deep learning and the traditional RL approach has created an advanced technique called deep Q-network (DQN) that has shown promising results in solving high-dimensional and complex problems, including traffic congestion. In this paper, DQN is embedded in traffic signal control to solve traffic congestion issue, which has been plagued with the curse of dimensionality whereby the representation of the operating environment can be highly dimensional and complex when the traditional RL approach is used. Most importantly, this paper proposes multi-agent DQN (MADQN) and investigates its use to further address the curse of dimensionality under traffic network scenarios with high traffic volume and disturbances. To investigate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme, a case study based on an urban area, namely Sunway city in Malaysia, is conducted. We evaluate our scheme via simulation using a traffic network simulator called simulation of urban mobility (SUMO) and a simulation tool called MATLAB. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme reduces the total travel time of the vehicles. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",This work was part of the project entitled “A Novel Clustering Algorithm based on Reinforcement Learning for the Optimization of Global and Local Network Performances in Mobile Networks” funded by the Malaysian Ministry of Education under Fundamental Research Grant Scheme FRGS/1/2019/ICT03/SYUC/01/1 .,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083002518,Yes,Malaysia,Transportation,Urban Mobility,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"Deep Reinforcement Learning, Multi-agent RL",Control/Optimization,"Apply deep reinforcement learning for traffic signal control under disturbances in Sunway city, Malaysia",SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

Different models of indicators have been developed to follow cities’ evolution to become a Smart City. An example of such model is the standard 37120 from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that proposes a set of dimensions and indicators (e.g. Transportation, Recreation, Solid Waste) for services and quality of life for sustainable cities and communities. It has been common to find official social network profiles of organizations and governmental entities related to the services they provide or are responsible for (water, waste, transportation, cultural events, etc.) and that are used by citizens as a gateway to directly interact and communicate their complains and problems about those services. The present paper proposes to apply machine learning algorithms over the urban data generated by social networks in order to create classifiers to automatically categorize citizens messages according to the different cities services dimensions. For that, two distinct text datasets in Portuguese were collected from two social networks: Twitter (1,950 tweets) and Colab.re (65,066 posts). The texts were mapped according to the different ISO 37120 categories, preprocessed and mined through the use of 8 algorithms implemented in Scikit-Learn. Initial results pointed out the feasibility of the proposal with models achieving average F1-measures around 55% for F1-macro and 78% for F1-micro when using Linear Vector Classification, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Complement Naive Bayes. However, as the datasets were highly unbalanced, the performances of the models vary significantly for each ISO category, with the best results occurring for Wastewater, Water & Sanitation, Energy and Transportation. The classifiers generated here can be integrated on a number of different city services and systems such as: governmental support decision systems, customer complain systems, communities dashboards, police offices, transportation's companies, cultural producers, environmental agencies, and recyclers’ companies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","This work is supported by CAPES (Coordination of Improvement for Post-Graduated Level Personnel), Brazil , FAPESC (Foundation for Research and Innovation Support of the State of Santa Catarina), Brazil , and CNPq (Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development) [DT-2 Productivity in Technological Development and Innovative Extension scholarship, proc. 315445/2018-1].",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082946462,Yes,Brazil,Social Media Analysis,Urban Governance,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Text Classification,Classification,Automate classification of social network messages into smart cities dimensions for monitoring urban evolution,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

The accurate traffic speed prediction is affected by many contextual factors such as abnormal traffic conditions, traffic incidents, lane closures due to construction or events, and traffic congestion. To overcome these problems, we propose a new method named fuzzy optimized long short-term memory (FOLSTM) neural network for long-term traffic speed prediction. FOLSTM technique is a hybrid method composed of computational intelligence (CI), machine learning (ML), and metaheuristic techniques, capable of predicting the speed for macroscopic traffic key parameters. First, the proposed hybrid unsupervised learning method, agglomerated hierarchical K-means (AHK) clustering, divides the input samples into a group of clusters. Second, based on parameters the Gaussian bell-shaped fuzzy membership function calculates the degree of membership (high, low, and medium) for each cluster using Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy rules. Finally, the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is used in LSTM to optimize the parameters obtained by fuzzy rules and calculate the optimal weight value. FOLSTM evaluates the accurate traffic speed from the abnormal traffic data to overcome the nonlinear characteristics. Experimental results demonstrated that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of metrics such as mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85080151443,Yes,India,Transportation,Urban Mobility,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"LSTM, Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy",Prediction/Forecasting,Develop improved LSTM networks with Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy for traffic speed prediction considering abnormal traffic situations,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

In this field, the Web offers many opportunities, such as the e-learning platforms where students can learn, according to their own needs and pace. The massive open online courses (MOOCs) are particular distance learning platforms, generally offering, so far, free courses on a huge amount of topics, and characterized by a (potentially) very high number of enrollments. In a MOOC, a teacher, or tutor, has a hard life when trying to follow and manage with the learning processes of thousands of students. In particular, assessment can be managed almost exclusively by letting the student answer questions in closed answers tests. This strategy has some didactic limits, while a valid alternative is to use peer assessment (PA) over more articulated assessment activities (e.g., open-ended questions). PA makes students grade their peers’ answers, and provides learners with significant advantages, such as refining their knowledge of the subject matter, and developing their meta-cognitive skills. In this work, we present a software platform called K-OpenAnswer, which helps teachers to simulate the dynamic of a MOOC where PA is used. The system uses a machine learning technique, based on a modified version of the K-NN algorithm, and provides teachers with a statistical environment by which they can monitor the evolving dynamic of a simulated MOOC, according to the techniques we use to implement PA. An experimental evaluation is presented that highlights the advantages of using the system as a valid tool for the study of real MOOCs. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078328465,Yes,Italy,Education,Urban Services,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Simulation,Simulation,Develop a simulation environment to analyze dynamics of massive open online courses in smart cities,SDG 4: Quality Education; SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

In this paper, we focus on two major aspects of the Twitter social network associated with altmetrics: (a) to analyze the properties of bots on Twitter networks and (b) to distinguish between bots and human accounts. Firstly, we employed state-of-the-art social network analysis techniques that exploit Twitter’s social network properties in novel altmetrics data. We found that 87% of tweets are affected by bots that are involved in the network’s dominant communities. We also found that, to some extent, community size and the degree of distribution in Twitter’s altmetrics network follow a power-law distribution. Furthermore, we applied a deep learning model, graph convolutional networks, to distinguish between organic (human) and bot Twitter accounts. The deployed model achieved the promising results, providing up to 71% classification accuracy over 200 epochs. Overall, the study concludes that bot presence in altmetrics-associated social media platforms can artificially inflate the number of social usage counts. As a result, special attention is required to eliminate such discrepancies when using altmetrics data for smart decision-making, such as research assessment either independently or complementary along with traditional bibliometric indices. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","This project was funded by the Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR), King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, under Grant No. (D-106-611-1440).

Electronic shopping has become the hotbeds of many customers as it is easier to judge the quality of the product based on the review information.

The prediction is done using a two-layered convolutional neural network model. The review texts are embedded into low-dimensional vectors using a pre-trained model. To learn the best features of the review text, three filters are used to learn tri-gram, four-gram, and five-gram features of the text. The proposed approach is found to be better than existing machine learning based models which used hand-crafted features. The very low value of mean squared error confirms the prediction accuracy of the proposed method.

Recently, innovation in artificial intelligence (AI) in the shape of self-driving cars, robots and city brains, has been pushing the so-called smart city to morph into an autonomous urban creature which is largely unknown. In this emerging strand of smart urbanism, artificially intelligent entities are taking the management of urban services as well as urban governance out of the hands of humans, operating the city in an autonomous manner. This paper explores, in theory and practice, how the development of AI intersects with the development of the city. The contribution of the paper is threefold. First, the paper advances a theoretical framework to understand AI specifically in urban contexts. It develops the concept of urban artificial intelligence, capturing the main manifestations of AI in cities. Second, the paper examines the case of Masdar City, an Emirati urban experiment, to show how the genesis of urban artificial intelligences is part of a long-standing process of technological development and a politico-economic agenda which together are enabling the transition from automation to autonomy.

Accurate predictions can enable both the drivers and the passengers to make better decisions about their travel route, departure time, and travel origin selection, which can be helpful in traffic management. Multiple models and algorithms based on time-series prediction and machine learning were applied to this issue and achieved acceptable results. Recently, the availability of sufficient data and computational power motivates us to improve the prediction accuracy via deep-learning approaches. Recurrent neural networks have become one of the most popular methods for time-series forecasting; however, due to the variety of these networks, the question that which type is the most appropriate one for this task remains unsolved. In this paper, we use three kinds of recurrent neural networks including simple RNN units, GRU, and LSTM neural network to predict short-term traffic flow. The dataset from TAP30 Corporation is used for building the models and comparing RNNs with several well-known models, such as DEMA, LASSO, and XGBoost. The results show that all three types of RNNs outperform the others; however, more simple RNNs such as simple recurrent units and GRU perform work better than LSTM in terms of accuracy and training time. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis.",This research is financially supported by TAP30 Co. and also the authors are grateful to TAP30 Co. for providing sample data.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087082622,Yes,Iran,Transportation,Urban Mobility,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Recurrent Neural Network (RNN),Prediction/Forecasting,Develop short-term demand forecasting for online car-hailing services using recurrent neural networks,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

Vehicle detection and recognition, which is one of the most important aspects of intelligent transportation, plays a very important role in various areas of our daily life; one such important area is criminal investigation. In the fine-grained vehicle type detection and recognition, several difficult issues such as problems in data acquisition and tagging, dramatic variance in the data of different vehicle types, and challenges in identifying vehicles of the same brand with highly similar appearances remain unsolved. For the problems of data acquisition and tagging, this paper presents a strategy for automatic data acquisition and tagging based on object detection that can label the vehicle images efficiently while rapidly acquiring all types of fine-grained models. Considering the problem of data imbalance in the training process, this paper proposes a Faster-RCNN based data equalizing strategy (Faster-BRCNN), thereby improving the performance of object detection. In view of the severe information attenuation caused by the feature information transfer obstruct between layers in the traditional deep learning network, the lack of mutual dependency of these features, and the inability of the network to focus on the important region and characteristics, we propose an intensive dense attention network (DA-Net). Through its intensive connection and attention unit, we enhance the model's detection ability.

These villages contain many closely packed buildings constructed decades ago without proper urban planning. There is a need for those buildings to be identified and put into statistics. In this paper, we present a segmentation framework that invokes multiple machine learning techniques and point cloud/image processing algorithms to segment individual closely packed buildings from large urban scenes. The presented framework consists of two major segmentation processes. The framework first filters out the non-ground objects from the point cloud, then it classified them by using the Random Forest classifier to isolate buildings from the entire scene. After that, the building point clouds will be segmented based on several building attribute analysis methods. This is followed by using the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) plane filtering method to expand the space between two closely packed buildings, so that the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering technique can be used to more accurately segment each individual building from the closely packed building areas. Two airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) datasets collected in two different cities with some typical closely packed buildings were used to verify the proposed framework. The results show that the framework can effectively identify the closely packed buildings with unified structures from large airborne LiDAR datasets. The overall segmentation accuracy reaches 84% for the two datasets. The proposed framework can serve as a basis for analysis and segmentation of closely packed buildings with a more complicated structure. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","This research was supported by the 100 Talent Program Initiation Fund offered to Ting On Chan.

LUR models leverage information about environmental and anthropogenic factors such as cars, heating, or industry to predict air pollution in areas where no measurements have been made. However, existing approaches are often not globally applicable and require tedious hyper-parameter tuning to enable high quality predictions. In this work, we tackle these issues by introducing OpenLUR, an off-the-shelf approach for modeling air pollution that (i) works on a set of novel features solely extracted from the globally and openly available data source OpenStreetMap and (ii) is based on state-of-the-art machine learning featuring automated hyper-parameter tuning in order to minimize manual effort. We show that our proposed features are able to outperform their counterparts from local and closed sources, and illustrate how automated hyper parameter tuning can yield competitve results while alleviating the need for expert knowledge in machine learning and manual effort. Importantly, we further demonstrate the potential of the global availability of our features by applying cross-learning across different cities in order to reduce the need for a large amount of training samples. Overall, OpenLUR represents an off-the-shelf approach that facilitates easily reproducible experiments and the development of globally applicable models. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",This work has been partially funded by the DFG grant “p2Map: Learning Environmental Maps - Integrating Participatory Sensing and Human Perception” (Grant-nr: 314699772 ).,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084574452,Yes,Germany,Air Quality,Environmental Quality,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,"Machine Learning, Land Use Regression",Prediction/Forecasting,Develop an off-the-shelf air pollution modeling approach using open features and machine learning,SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being; SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

Land-use distribution is one of the key factors affecting air quality, and research on the impact of land-use distribution on air pollution has drawn wide attention. However, considerable studies have mostly used linear regression models, which fail to capture the nonlinear effects of land-use distribution on PM<inf>2.5</inf> (fine particulate matter with a diameter less than or equal to 2.5 microns) and to show how impacts on PM<inf>2.5</inf> vary with land-use magnitudes. In addition, related studies have generally focused on annual analyses, ignoring the seasonal variability of the impact of land-use distribution on PM<inf>2.5</inf>, thus leading to possible estimation biases for PM<inf>2.5</inf> . This study was designed to address these issues and assess the impacts of land-use distribution on PM<inf>2.5</inf> in Weifang, China. A machine learning statistical model, the boosted regression tree (BRT), was applied to measure nonlinear effects of land-use distribution on PM<inf>2.5</inf>, capture how land-use magnitude impacts PM<inf>2.5</inf> across different seasons, and explore the policy implications for urban planning. The main conclusions are that the air quality will significantly improve with an increase in grassland and forest area, especially below 8% and 20%, respectively. When the distribution of construction land is greater than around 10%, the PM<inf>2.5</inf> pollution can be seriously substantially increased with the increment of their areas. The impact of gardens and farmland presents seasonal characteristics. It is noted that as the weather becomes colder, the inhibitory effect of vegetation distribution on the PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentration gradually decreases, while the positive impacts of artificial surface distributions, such as construction land and roads, are aggravated because leaves drop off in autumn (September–November) and winter (December–February). According to the findings of this study, it is recommended that Weifang should strengthen pollution control in winter, for instance, expand the coverage areas of evergreen vegetation like Pinus bungeana Zucc. and Euonymus japonicus Thunb, and increase the width and numbers of branches connecting different main roads. The findings also provide quantitative and optimal land-use planning and strategies to minimize PM<inf>2.5</inf> pollution, referring to the status of regional urbanization and greening construction. © 2020 by the authors.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in analyzing such data. It becomes difficult to select optimal algorithm from the available set of algorithms/classifiers to obtain best results. The performance of algorithms differs when applied to datasets from different application domains. In learning, it is difficult to understand if the difference in performance is real or due to random variation in test data, training data, or internal randomness of the learning algorithms. This study takes into account these issues during a comparison of ML algorithms for binary and multivariate classification. It helps in providing guidelines for statistical validation of results. The results obtained show that the performance measure of accuracy for one algorithm differs by critical difference (CD) than others over binary and multivariate datasets obtained from different application domains. © © 2020, IGI Global.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097727857,No,India,General AI/ML,Technology,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Machine Learning Algorithms,Comparison,Provide statistical comparison of machine learning algorithms using parametric and non-parametric tests,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure",Methodological,,,,,

Security problems have a different nature-to name a few, we can think of the problems deriving from citizens' mobility, then move on to microcrime, and end up with the ever-present risk of terrorism. Equipping a smart city with an infrastructure of sensors capable of alerting security managers about a possible risk becomes crucial for the safety of citizens. The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to manage citizens' needs is now widespread, to highlight the possible risks to public safety. These risks were then increased using these devices to carry out terrorist attacks in various places around the world. Detecting the presence of drones is not a simple procedure given the small size and the presence of only rotating parts. This study presents the results of studies carried out on the detection of the presence of UAVs in outdoor/indoor urban sound environments. For the detection of UAVs, sensors capable of measuring the sound emitted by UAVs and algorithms based on deep neural networks capable of identifying their spectral signature that were used. The results obtained suggest the adoption of this methodology for improving the safety of smart cities. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Smart cities sustainability depends on the availability of energy-efficient infrastructures and services. Buildings compose most of the city, and they are responsible for most of the energy consumption and emissions to the atmosphere (40%). Smart cities need smart buildings to achieve sustainability goals. Building s thermal modeling is essential to face the energy efficiency race. In this paper, we show how ICT and data science technologies and techniques can be applied to evaluate the energy efficiency of buildings. In concrete, we apply machine learning techniques to classify buildings based on their energy efficiency. Particularly, our focus is on single-family buildings in residential areas. Along this paper, we demonstrate the capabilities of machine learning techniques to classify buildings depending on their energy efficiency. Moreover, we analyze and compare the performance of different classifiers. Furthermore, we introduce new parameters which have some impact on the buildings thermal modeling, especially those concerning the environment where the building is located. We also make an insight on ICT and remark the growing relevance in data acquisition and monitoring of relevant parameters by using wireless sensor networks. It is worthy to remark the need for an appropriate and reliable dataset to achieve the best results.

Centrality can help in understanding the structural properties of dense traffic networks that affect both human life and activity in cities. Many cities classify urban streets to provide stakeholders with a group of street guidelines for possible new rehabilitation such as sidewalks, curbs, and setbacks. Transportation research always considers street networks as a connection between different urban areas. The street functionality classification defines the role of each element of the urban street network (USN). Some potential factors such as land use mix, accessible service, design goal, and administrators' policies can affect the movement pattern of urban travelers. In this study, nine centrality measures are used to classify the urban roads in four cities evaluating the structural importance of street segments. In our work, a Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDAE) predicts a street's functionality, then logistic regression is used as a classifier. Our proposed classifier can differentiate between four different classes adopted from the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDT): principal arterial road, minor arterial road, collector road, and local road. The SDAE-based model showed that regular grid configurations with repeated patterns are more influential in forming the functionality of road networks compared to those with less regularity in their spatial structure. © 2020 by the authors.

Comprehensive methodological frameworks that account for the increasingly uncertain future state of the urban mobility landscape do not yet exist. Furthermore, few approaches have enabled the massive ingestion of urban data in planning tools capable of offering the flexibility of scenario-based design. This article introduces Berkeley Integrated System for Transportation Optimization (BISTRO), a new open source transportation planning decision support system that uses an agent-based simulation and optimization approach to anticipate and develop adaptive plans for possible technological disruptions and growth scenarios. The new framework was evaluated in the context of a machine learning competition hosted within Uber Technologies, Inc., in which over 400 engineers and data scientists participated. For the purposes of this competition, a benchmark model, based on the city of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, was adapted to the BISTRO framework. An important finding of this study was that in spite of rigorous analysis and testing done prior to the competition, the two top-scoring teams discovered an unbounded region of the search space, rendering the solutions largely uninterpretable for the purposes of decision-support. On the other hand, a follow-on study aimed to fix the objective function. It served to demonstrate BISTRO's utility as a human-in-the-loop cyberphysical system: one that uses scenario-based optimization algorithms as a feedback mechanism to assist urban planners with iteratively refining objective function and constraints specification on intervention strategies. The portfolio of transportation intervention strategy alternatives eventually chosen achieves high-level regional planning goals developed through participatory stakeholder engagement practices. © 2020 ACM.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089274941,Yes,United States,Transportation,Urban Mobility,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Optimization Framework,Optimization,"Present BISTRO, a comprehensive framework for urban transportation optimization considering future urban mobility technologies",SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Methodological,Mixed,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

In the first level of the framework, the similarity measures of DNS queries are estimated using siamese networks based on a predefined threshold for selecting the most frequent DNS information across Ethernet connections. In the second level of the framework, a domain generation algorithm based on deep learning architectures is suggested for categorizing normal and abnormal domain names.

Urban sprawl has imposed adverse economic and environmental impacts on cities. Therefore, study, measurement and recognition of this phenomenon are essential. The purpose of this study is the identification and measurement of urban sprawl intensity in the Urmia city (capital of West Azerbaijan Province of Iran). It causes urban planners and managers to better plan for the future growth of the Urmia and achieve sustainable urban development with greater awareness and understanding. The present research is a theoretical–applied research purpose and is descriptive–analytic in terms of research nature. Several methods have been used for measuring urban sprawl. Nowadays, landscape metrics and spatial data are widely used worldwide because they detected urban sprawl with great detail and accuracy. Thus, in the present research, in order to measure urban sprawl in Urmia city, the black-and-white hypothesis and satellite imagery and integration of these data with landscape metrics have been used for the first time in Iran. In this regard, satellite images of 1991, 2001, 2011 and 2016 were collected with the help of Landsat satellite. These images were classified using an artificial neural network in two classes: built and non-built. Then the detection of changes was done using ENVI 5.3 software and also using landscape metrics (fractal dimension index, largest patch index, contiguity index, number of patches index and shape index) by Fragstats 4.2 software in order to measure urban sprawl in Urmia city. The results of this study indicate that urban sprawl in Urmia during the period of 1991–2011 had a decreasing rate and from then until now has been increasing and it will be continued. © 2020, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089033519,Yes,Iran,Urban Planning and Development,Urban Planning,Urban Development & Land Use,"Landscape Metrics, Black-and-White Hypothesis",Measurement/Analysis,Evaluate urban sprawl using landscape metrics and black-and-white hypothesis for Urmia City,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Past,Longitudinal,Medium

Lately, Smart Cities are benefiting from the rising of Big Data coming from IoT devices, leading to improvements on monitoring and prevention. However, monitoring and prevention processes require visualization techniques as a key component. Indeed, in order to prevent possible hazards (such as fires, leaks, etc.) and optimize their resources, Smart Cities require adequate visualizations that provide insights to decision makers. Nevertheless, visualization of Big Data has always been a challenging issue, especially when such data are originated in real-time. This problem becomes even bigger in Smart City environments since we have to deal with many different groups of users and multiple heterogeneous data sources. Without a proper visualization methodology, complex dashboards including data from different nature are difficult to understand. In order to tackle this issue, we propose a methodology based on visualization techniques for Big Data, aimed at improving the evidence-gathering process by assisting users in the decision making in the context of Smart Cities. Moreover, in order to assess the impact of our proposal, a case study based on service calls for a fire department is presented. In this sense, our findings will be applied to data coming from citizen calls. Thus, the results of this work will contribute to the optimization of resources, namely fire extinguishing battalions, helping to improve their effectiveness and, as a result, the sustainability of a Smart City, operating better with less resources.

The main emphasis was placed on the sectors of critical urban infrastructure, including in particular the use of algorithmic models based on artificial intelligence implemented in supervisory control systems (SCADA-type, including Virtual SCADA) of technological processes involving the sewage treatment systems (including in particular wastewater treatment systems) and waste management systems. The novelty of the presented solution involves the use of predictive diagnostic tools, based on multi-threaded polymorphic models supporting decision making processes during the control of a complex technological process and objects of distributed network systems (smart water grid, smart sewage system, smart waste management system) and solving problems of optimal control for smart dynamic objects with logical representation of knowledge about the process, the control object and the control itself, for which the learning process consists of successive validation and updating of knowledge and the use of the results of this updating to make control decisions. The advantage of the proposed solution in relation to the existing ones lies in the use of advanced models of predictive diagnostics, validation and reconstruction of data, implemented in functional tools, allowing the stabilization of the work of technological objects through the use of FTC technology (fault tolerant control) and soft sensors, predictive measurement path diagnostics (sensors, transducers), validation and reconstruction of measurement data from sensors in the measuring paths in real time. The dedicated tools (Intelligent Real Time Diagnostic System − iRTDS) built into the system of a hierarchical, multi-threaded control optimizing system of SCADA system allow to obtain advanced diagnostics of technological processes in real time using HPC technology. In effect of the application of the proprietary iRTDS tool, we obtain a significant rise of energy efficiency of technological processes in key sectors of the economy, which in global terms, e.g., urban agglomeration, increases the economic efficiency. © 2020 by the authors.","Funding text 1: Funding: The work was performed in the framework of the national operational program project “publication supported within the Rector’s Professor’s Grant; Silesian University of Technology, 08/040/RGP19/0123”.; Funding text 2: The models of state and event space are part of the knowledge base on control objects.

Predicting the next location is a well-studied problem in human mobility, which finds several applications in real-world scenarios, from optimizing the efficiency of electronic dispatching systems to predicting and reducing the traffic jam. This task is normally modeled as a multiclass classification problem, where the goal is to select, among a set of already known locations, the next taxi destination. We present a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) approach that models the taxi drivers' behavior and encodes the semantics of visited locations by using geographical information from Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs). In particular, the RNNs are trained to predict the exact coordinates of the next destination, overcoming the problem of producing, in output, a limited set of locations, seen during the training phase.

We show that using information from pervasive Wi-Fi access points and Bluetooth devices can enhance GPS and geographic information to improve transportation detection on smartphones. Wi-Fi information also improves the identification of transportation mode and helps conserve battery since it is already collected by most mobile phones. Our approach uses a machine learning approach to determine the mode from pre-prepocessed data. This approach yields an overall accuracy of 89% and average F<inf>1</inf> score of 83% for inferring the three grouped modes of self-powered, car-based, and public transportation. When broken out by individual modes, Wi-Fi features improve detection accuracy of bus trips, train travel, and driving compared to GPS features alone and can substitute for GIS features without decreasing performance. Our results suggest that Wi-Fi and Bluetooth can be useful in urban transportation research, for example by improving mobile travel surveys and urban sensing applications. © 2020 Bjerre-Nielsen et al.

In addition to assisting traffic management authorities, traffic forecasting can help drivers to choose the best path to their destinations. Accurate traffic forecasting is a basic requirement for traffic management. We propose a traffic forecasting approach that utilizes air pollution and atmospheric parameters. Air pollution levels are often associated with traffic intensity, and much work is already available in which air pollution has been predicted using road traffic. However, to the best of our knowledge, an attempt to improve forecasting road traffic using air pollution and atmospheric parameters is not yet available in the literature. In our preliminary experiments, we found out the relation between traffic intensity, air pollution, and atmospheric parameters. Therefore, we believe that addition of air pollutants and atmospheric parameters can improve the traffic forecasting. Our method uses air pollution gases, including CO, NO, NO<inf>2</inf>, NO<inf>x</inf>, and O<inf>3</inf> . We chose these gases because they are associated with road traffic. Some atmospheric parameters, including pressure, temperature, wind direction, and wind speed have also been considered, as these parameters can play an important role in the dispersion of the above-mentioned gases. Data related to traffic flow, air pollution, and the atmosphere were collected from the open data portal of Madrid, Spain.

In this paper, we propose a holistic framework to enhance the operation of coordinated electric power distribution network (PDN) and urban transportation network (UTN) via EV charging services. Under this framework, a bi-level model is formulated to optimally determine EVCS charging service fees (CSF) for guiding EV charging behaviors and minimizing the total social cost. At the upper level, PDN with wind power generation is formulated as a second-order cone problem (SOCP) where CSF is determined. Given the settings calculated at the upper level, the lower level problem is described as a traffic assignment problem (TAP) which is subject to the user equilibrium (UE) principle and captures the individual rationality of single EV owners in UTN. The uncertainties in wind power output and origin-destination (O-D) traffic demands are considered in the proposed model and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based solution framework is developed to decouple and approximately solve the stochastic bi-level problem. Both gradient-based and gradient-free training algorithms are implemented in this paper and the respective results are compared. The case studies on a 5-node system, 24-node Sioux-Falls system and real-world Xi'an city in China are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, which demonstrates the enhanced operation of coordinated PDN and UTN networks by reducing the traffic congestion and improving the integration of renewable energy. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 51707146 and Grant U1766205.

It implies that the users are more likely to park the SFSB as close as their destinations. This advantage makes the SFSB data to be an ideal source to understand the land-use distribution. Inspired by the idea in text mining, this paper proposes a topic-based two-stage SFSB data mining algorithm to understand the SFSB user's travel behavior and to discover city functional regions. A region, a function and human mobility patterns are treated as a document, a topic and words, respectively. Then, a region is represented by a distribution of functions, and a function is featured by a distribution of mobility patterns. The point-of-interest data is combined to annotate the clustered regions to discover the real functions. At last, the proposed method is tested using 14-day SFSB data in Beijing and the results are estimated by the Satellite Map data.

Recently, with the rise of deep learning, end-to-end control for autonomous vehicles has been well studied. However, most works are solely based on visual information, which can be degraded by challenging illumination conditions such as dim light or total darkness. In addition, they usually generate and apply deterministic control commands without considering the uncertainties in the future. In this letter, based on imitation learning, we propose a probabilistic driving model with multi-perception capability utilizing the information from the camera, lidar and radar. We further evaluate its driving performance online on our new driving benchmark, which includes various environmental conditions (e.g., urban and rural areas, traffic densities, weather and times of the day) and dynamic obstacles (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, motorcyclists and bicyclists). The results suggest that our proposed model outperforms baselines and achieves excellent generalization performance in unseen environments with heavy traffic and extreme weather. © 2016 IEEE.","Manuscript received February 24, 2020; accepted April 21, 2020.

However, clashes arise during the process of land acquisition, out of conflicts of interests, which to some extent have affected the development and direction of urban expansion, as well as social harmony and stability. Therefore, the urban expansion simulation should be based on smooth land acquisition technique. In this study, urban expansion was simulated from the perspective of land acquisition, based on coupled bargaining model and modified ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm. First, the bargaining model with fairness preferences should be set up for the government and farmers, to search for the candidate areas for urban expansion, both sides of which could reach a consensus without conflicts of interest. Then, urban expansion simulation is applied to all the candidate areas, taking advantage of the modified ACO algorithm. The model considered the built-up area in Wuhan city as the demonstration area and simulated conditions of land use in 2016 and 2026. The result showed that the coupled model could simulate decision-making behavior of the government and farmers in land acquisition veritably, so as to protect farmers' economic interests, with an increase of over 50% on average, and ensure government's appropriate profit. Moreover, the simulation accuracies of the coupled model was found to be better than that of the traditional cellular automata model, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.65, which supports the effectiveness of the model in simulating urban expansion. Further, it was estimated that the urban land use of Wuhan will cover 516.22 km2 in 2026, and the southeastern part of the city will be the hot spot area of urban expansion. © 2020 The Authors","We sincerely thank the three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments and suggestions.

Loop closure detection (LCD) is an important module in a vSLAM system. Existing works with convolutional neural networks exhibit better performance on feature extraction, but this is far from enough. Concerning the characteristics of LCD, it is of great significance to have a customized loss function and a method to construct suitable training image sets. Based on this motivation, we propose a novel framework for LCD. Through a deep analysis of the distance relationships in the LCD problem, we propose the multi-tuplet clusters loss function together with mini-batch construction scheme. The proposed framework can map images to a low dimensional space and extract more discriminative image features, which help learn a more essential distance relationship of the LCD problem. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms many state-of-art approaches even in complex environments with strong appearance changes. Importantly, though the training process is computationally demanding, its online application is very efficient. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084470241,Yes,China,Autonomous Vehicles,Urban Mobility,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"Convolutional Neural Network, Deep Distance Learning",Object Detection,Develop improved deep distance learning for visual loop closure detection in smart city vSLAM systems,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

Ride-sharing, which refers to the sharing of car journeys so that more than one person travel in a car, and prevents the need for others to drive to a location themselves, is a critical solution to this issue. Before being introduced into one place, it needs a potential analysis. However, current studies did this kind of analysis based on home and work locations or social ties between people, which is not precise and straight enough. Few pieces of research departed from real mobility data, but uses time-consuming methodology. In this paper, we proposed an analysis framework to bridge this gap. We chose the case study of Tokyo area with over 1 million GPS travel records and trained a deep learning model to find out this potential. From the computation result, on average, nearly 26.97% of travel distance could be saved by ride-sharing, which told us that there is a significant similarity in the travel pattern of people in Tokyo and there is considerable potential of ride-sharing. Moreover, if half of the original public transit riders in our study case adopt ride-sharing, the quantity of CO<inf>2</inf> is estimated to be reduced by 84.52%; if all of the original public transit riders in our study case adopt ride-sharing, 83.56% of CO<inf>2</inf> emission reduction can be expected with a rebound effect because of increase of participants from public transit. Ride-sharing can not only improve the air quality of these center business districts but also alleviate some city problems like traffic congestion. We believe the analysis of the potential of ride-sharing can provide insight into the decision making of ride-sharing service providers and decision-makers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","This work was partially supported by the JST, Strategic International Collaborative Research Program (SICORP); Leading Initiative for Excellent Young Researchers (LEADER) Program and Grant in-Aid for Scientific Research B (17H01784) of the Japan Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT).",Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083862149,Yes,China,Transportation,Urban Mobility,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,GPS Data Analysis,Assessment,Develop an assessment method for emission reduction potential of ride-sharing using mobile phone GPS data,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities; SDG 13: Climate Action,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

While scenario planning integrating urban growth prediction modeling is becoming more common, these models have not been effectively linked with future flood plain changes due to sea level rise. This study advances scenario planning by integrating urban growth prediction models with flood risk scenarios. The Land Transformation Model, a land change prediction model using a GIS based artificial neural network, is used to predict future urban growth scenarios for Tampa, Florida, USA, and future flood risks are then delineated based on the current 100-year floodplain using NOAA level rise scenarios. A multi-level evaluation using three urban prediction scenarios (business as usual, growth as planned, and resilient growth) and three sea level rise scenarios (low, high, and extreme) is conducted to determine how prepared Tampa's current land use plan is in handling increasing resilient development in lieu of sea level rise. Results show that the current land use plan (growth as planned) decreases flood risk at the city scale but not always at the neighborhood scale, when compared to no growth regulations (business as usual). However, flood risk when growing according to the current plan is significantly higher when compared to all future growth residing outside of the 100-year floodplain (resilient growth). Understanding the potential effects of sea level rise depends on understanding the probabilities of future development options and extreme climate conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","This work was supported by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences [ P42ES027704-01 ].

In order to achieve fast and accurate response to live video queries (e.g., license plate recording and object tracking), the real-time high-volume video streams should be delivered and analyzed efficiently.

Considering the locality of video queries, edge platform is designated as the system coordinator. It accepts live video queries and configures the related end cameras to generate video frames that meet quality requirements. By taking into account the latency constraint, edge computing resources are subtly distributed to process the live video frames from different sources such that the analytic accuracy of the accepted video queries can be maximized. Since the amount of required edge computing resource and video quality to accurately address different video queries are unknown in advance, we propose an online video quality and computing resource configuration algorithm to gradually learn the optimal configuration strategy.

Local emissions and urban structures can produce large spatial heterogeneities. We aim to improve the estimation of NO<inf>2</inf>, O<inf>3</inf>, PM<inf>2.5</inf> and PM<inf>10</inf> concentrations in 6 Italian metropolitan areas, using chemical-transport and machine learning models, and to assess the effect on population exposure by using information on urban population mobility. Three years (2013–2015) of simulations were performed by the Chemical-Transport Model (CTM) FARM, at 1 km resolution, fed by boundary conditions provided by national-scale simulations, local emission inventories and meteorological fields. A downscaling of daily air pollutants at higher resolution (200 m) was then carried out by means of a machine learning Random-Forest (RF) model, considering CTM and spatial-temporal predictors, such as population, land-use, surface greenness and vehicular traffic, as input. RF achieved mean cross-validation (CV) R2 of 0.59, 0.72, 0.76 and 0.75 for NO<inf>2</inf>, PM<inf>10</inf>, PM<inf>2.5</inf> and O<inf>3</inf>, respectively, improving results from CTM alone. Mean concentration fields exhibited clear geographical gradients caused by climate conditions, local emission sources and photochemical processes. Time series of population weighted exposure (PWE) were estimated for two months of the year 2015 and for five cities, by combining population mobility data (derived from mobile phone traffic volumes data), and concentration levels from the RF model.

Developing smart city paradigm employs this communication platform for providing services to the users and granting distributed resource sharing. Mitigating adversary device selection in this platform prevents irrelevant data exchange and eases information access and exchange. External and internal communication hindering factors needs to be addressed to sustain uninterrupted communication. To improve the precision in communication security, an observation-based security system is modeled in this manuscript. This security system observes the local and global behavioral change in IoT device communication. The local and global behavioral changes are defined using device attributes and behavior modeling. The device and service provider input observations are processed by a neural network-based learning scheme to identify errors in the resource access. The communicating users and IoT devices are secured by selecting reputed service providers and data sources to improve the distributed resource utilization in IoT based smart city. The performance of the proposed scheme balances between security and resource utilization requirements of the users by reducing response loss and non-reputed device selection. © 2020","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Project funded by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, Project funded by National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2017YFB0503604; No. 2017YFB0503801), Project funded by Electronic fence system project, Project funded by the Project (0172018A) of FDCT and Project funded by the Project of Macao Foundation.; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the Project funded by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation , Project funded by National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2017YFB0503604 ; No. 2017YFB0503801 ), Project funded by Electronic fence system project , Project funded by the Project ( 0172018A ) of FDCT and Project funded by the Project of Macao Foundation .",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081013758,Yes,China,IoT and Edge Computing,Smart Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Behavior-based Learning,Optimization,Improve communication precision of IoT through behavior-based learning in smart city environment,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

Additionally, smart environments, such as smart healthcare systems, smart industries and smart cities, benefit from sensors and actuators interconnected through the IoT. However, the increase in IoT devices has brought with it the challenge of promptly detecting and combating the cybersecurity attacks and threats that target them, including malware, privacy breaches and denial of service attacks, among others. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes an intelligent architecture that integrates Complex Event Processing (CEP) technology and the Machine Learning (ML) paradigm in order to detect different types of IoT security attacks in real time. In particular, such an architecture is capable of easily managing event patterns whose conditions depend on values obtained by ML algorithms. Additionally, a model-driven graphical tool for security attack pattern definition and automatic code generation is provided, hiding all the complexity derived from implementation details from domain experts. The proposed architecture has been applied in the case of a healthcare IoT network to validate its ability to detect attacks made by malicious devices. The results obtained demonstrate that this architecture satisfactorily fulfils its objectives. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities and the European Union FEDER Funds [grant numbers FPU 17/02007, RTI2018-093608-B-C33, RTI2018-098156-B-C52 and RED2018-102654-T].

In this paper, a novel urban sound event classification model based on 2-order dense convolutional network using dual features is proposed, which aims at the problems of insufficient classification accuracy and adaptability of current models. Firstly, the brief introduction of urban sound classification development and application is presented in Section 1. Then, the method of feature extraction and add noise environment is respectively introduced in Section 2. Moreover, a new network structure referred to as 2-order dense convolutional network (shorten as 2-DenseNet) and its algorithm are presented in Section 3. Meanwhile, an urban sound event classification model based on 2-DenseNet using dual features, i.e. D-2-DenseNet is proposed in this paper. Theoretically, D-2-DenseNet not only can accelerate the convergence speed when compared with DenseNet, but also can enhance the classification accuracy and guarantee a good generalization ability owing to the fact that dual features fusion is exploited in the proposed model. Finally, in order to validate advantages of the D-2-DenseNet, this new model is respectively exploited in the urban sound event classification based on UrbanSound8K and Dcase2016 datasets. The experimental result shows that the accuracy of the network is respectively 84.83% and 85.17%, which has increase up to 13.81% and 7.07% compared with baseline.

It affects daily stress levels of drivers and citizens. To design the future cities, parking process should be handled efficiently to improve drivers’ time comfort and fuel economy toward a green smart city (SC) ecosystem. In this paper, we propose to model smart parking (SP) with multiagent system (MAS) using long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network. Our model outperforms similar approaches as evidenced from the presented results using an online dataset from the SC of Aarhus, Denmark. We use LSTM for stochastic prediction based on periodic data provided by parking sensors. A SP provides such data on daily basis over a short period of time in the SC. We evaluate the proposed MAS with the prediction accuracy metric and compare it with other approaches in the literature. The proposed system achieves higher prediction accuracy per daily basis than the compared approaches due to our stochastic periodic prediction design and input to the proposed MAS and LSTM model. In addition, LSTM is used more efficiently under the proposed architecture of MAS, which enables online scaling thanks to dynamic and distributed nature of MAS. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","The part of this work has been carried out in the scope of the project bIoTope which is co-funded by the European Commission under the Horizon-2020 program, Contract Number H2020-ICT-2015/688203 – bIoTope.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075213113,Yes,Greece,Transportation,Urban Mobility,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,LSTM,Prediction/Forecasting,Develop distributed modeling of smart parking system using LSTM with stochastic periodic predictions,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

Face recognition technology lets the police detect a suspect's face and compare it with image databases of known criminals and provides investigators with a match list of the most similar faces. Face recognition is a highly efficient and accurate tool in investigation processes. However, in some sensitive scenarios covert methods are required for the detection of suspects or missing persons without risking the lives of police. With the availability of the nano devices such as Raspberry Pi, law enforcement agencies such as police can be equipped with a concealed and secure face recognition system. In this paper, a Raspberry Pi and cloud assisted face recognition framework is proposed. A small-sized portable wireless camera is mounted on a police officer's uniform to capture a video stream, which is passed to Raspberry Pi for face detection and recognition. The proposed method uses Bag of Words for extraction of oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF points from the detected face, followed by support vector machine for identification of suspects. Raspberry Pi has limited resources such as storage space, memory, and processing power, and therefore the proposed classifier is stored and trained on the cloud. The proposed method is implemented on Raspberry Pi 3 model B in Python 2.7 and is tested on various standard datasets. Experimental results validate the efficiency of the proposed method in accurate detection of faces compared to state-of-the-art face detection and recognition methods, and verify its effectiveness for enhancing law-enforcement services in smart cities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",This research is supported by: Start-up Research Grant Program through Research and Development Division (R & D Division) funded by Higher Education Commission of Pakistan ( 21-1498/SRGP/R&D/HEC/2016 ) and National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF ) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIP) (No. 2016R1A2B4011712 ).,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85036618899,Yes,Pakistan,Public Safety and Security,Urban Services,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Face Recognition,Object Detection,Develop a Raspberry Pi assisted face recognition framework for enhanced law-enforcement services in smart cities,"SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities; SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Weak

Cellular automata (CA) are extensively employed given their simplicity, flexibility, and intuitiveness when simulating dynamic LUC. Previous research, however, has ignored the spatial heterogeneity among sub-regions, instead applying the same transition rules across entire regions; moreover, most existing methods extract neighborhood effects with only one data time slice, which is inconsistent with the nature of neighborhood interactions as a long-term process exhibiting obvious spatiotemporal dependency. Accordingly, we propose a hybrid cellular automata model coupling area partitioning and spatiotemporal neighborhood features learning, named PST-CA. We use a machine-learning-based partitioning strategy, self-organizing map (SOM), to divide entire regions into several homogeneous sub-regions, and further apply a spatiotemporal three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D CNN) to extract the spatiotemporal neighborhood features. An artificial neural network (ANN) is then built to create a conversion probability map for each sub-region using both spatiotemporal neighborhood features and factors that drive the LUC. Finally, the dynamic simulation results of entire study area are generated by fusing these probability maps, constraints and stochastic factors. Land use data collected from 2000 to 2015 in Shanghai were selected to verify our proposed method. Four traditional models were implemented for comparison, including logistic regression (LR)-CA, support vector machine (SVM)-CA, random forest (RF)-CA and conventional ANN-CA. Results illustrate that the proposed PST-CA outperformed four traditional models, with overall accuracy increased by 4.66%~6.41%. Moreover, three distinctly different “coverage rate-growth rate” composite patterns of built-up areas are shown in the SOM partitioning results, which verifies SOM's ability to address spatial heterogeneity; while the optimal time steps in 3D CNN generally maintained a positive correlation with the growth rate of built-up areas, which implies longer temporal dependency should be captured for rapidly developing areas. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Funding text 1: The National Natural Science Foundation of China program (Grant No.: 41971348 ).

This imminent reality of planetary urbanization is likely to entail drastic environmental, economic, and social changes, all of which in turn are likely to impact the nature of human relations and their interactions in cities. Urban ethics is, therefore, concerned with the question of what ought to be the proper relations between people flourishing in the city? This question is presently compounded by the rise of the 'smarter smart cities', where urban technologies are enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) that can sense, track, learn, predict, and attempt to control human behaviors. The rapid confluence of these three developments, namely, planetary urbanization, urban ethics, and the AI-powered smart city, reveals an under-explored scenario pregnant with new social promises yet laced with many moral hazards. In this article, the following scenario, which is bounded by the following three vectors, will be examined: (i) How does the urban shape the ethical, and in what ways? (ii) What is the AI-powered smart city, and how does it impact the present notion of planetary urbanization? (iii) How does the AI-powered smart city change ethical agencies and in which specific ways? Together, the answers to these questions begin to further prime discussions in urban bioethics in the milieu of AI-powered cities. © 2020 University of Rijeka, Faculty of Medicine.

A landslide inventory was built by historical records; satellite images; and extensive field surveys. Subsequently; a geospatial database was established based on 987 historical landslides in the study area. Then; all the landslides were randomly divided into two datasets: 70% of them were used as the training dataset and 30% as the test dataset. Furthermore; under five primary conditioning factors (i.e., topography factors; geological factors; environmental factors; human engineering activities; and triggering factors), 22 secondary conditioning factors were selected to form an evaluation factor library for analyzing the landslide susceptibility. On this basis; the RF model training and the FR model mathematical analysis were performed; and the established models were used for the landslide susceptibility simulation in the entire area of Yunyang County. Next; based on the analysis results; the susceptibility maps were divided into five classes: very low; low; medium; high; and very high. In addition; the importance of conditioning factors was ranked and the influence of landslides was explored by using the RF model. The area under the curve (AUC) value of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve; precision; accuracy; and recall ratio were used to analyze the predictive ability of the above two LSM models. The results indicated a difference in the performances between the two models. The RF model (AUC = 0.988) performed better than the FR model (AUC = 0.716). Moreover; compared with the FR model; the RF model showed a higher coincidence degree between the areas in the high and the very low susceptibility classes; on the one hand; and the geographical spatial distribution of historical landslides; on the other hand. Therefore; it was concluded that the RF model was more suitable for landslide susceptibility evaluation in Yunyang County; because of its significant model performance; reliability; and stability. The outcome also provided a theoretical basis for application of machine learning techniques (e.g., RF) in landslide prevention; mitigation; and urban planning; so as to deliver an adequate response to the increasing demand for effective and low-cost tools in landslide susceptibility assessments. © 2020 by the authors.

Some studies have used point of interest (POI) data and smart card data (SCD) to conduct subway station classifications; however, the unity of both the model and the dataset limits the prediction results. This paper not only uses SCD and POI data, but also adds Online to Offline (OTO) e-commerce platform data, an application that provides customers with information about different businesses, like the location, the score, the comments, and so on. In this paper, these data are combined to and used to analyze each subway station, considering the diversity of data, and obtain a passenger flow feature map of different stations, the number of different types of POIs within 800 m, and the situation of surrounding OTO stores. This paper proposes a two-stage framework, to identify the functional region of subway stations. In the passenger flow stage, the SCD feature is extracted and converted to a feature map, and a ResNet model is used to get the output of stage 1. In the built environment stage, the POI and OTO features are extracted, and a deep neural network with stacked autoencoders (SAE–DNN) model is used to get the output of stage 2. Finally, the outputs of the two stages are connected and a SoftMax function is used to make the final identification of functional region. We performed experimental testing, and our experimental results show that the framework exhibits good performance and has a certain reference value in the planning of subway stations and their surroundings, contributing to the construction of smart cities. © 2020 by the authors.

It is necessary to establish an accurate urban sprawl measurement system. First, the regulation theory of urban sprawl is explained. According to the actual development situation of cities in the Yangtze River Economic Belt, smart growth theory is selected as the basic regulation method of urban sprawl. Second, the back propagation neural network (BPNN) algorithm under deep supervised learning is applied to construct a smart evaluation model of land use growth. Finally, based on the actual development of cities in the Yangtze River Economic Belt, the quantitative growth measurement method is selected to construct a measurement system of urban sprawl in the Yangtze River Economic Belt, and the empirical analysis is carried out. The training results show that the proposed BPNN smart growth evaluation model, based on deep supervised learning, has good evaluation accuracy, and the error is within the preset range. The analysis of the quantitative growth-based measurement system in the increase of urban construction land shows that the increase in urban construction land area of the Yangtze River Economic Belt from 2014 to 2019 was 78.67 km2. Meanwhile, the increases in urban construction land area in different years are different. The empirical results show that the population composition of the Yangtze River Economic Belt and the urban construction area between 2005 and 2019 show a trend of increasing annually; at the same time, urban sprawl development shows a staged characteristic. It is of great significance to apply deep learning fusion neural network algorithm in the construction of the urban sprawl measurement system, which provides a quantitative basis for the in-depth analysis and discussion of urban sprawl. © 2020 by the authors.

Traditionally, this task is performed by surveys or manual photo interpretation, which are expensive and difficult to update regularly. We seek to characterize usages at the single object level and to differentiate classes such as educational institutes, hospitals and religious places by visual cues contained in side-view pictures from Google Street View (GSV). These pictures provide geo-referenced information not only about the material composition of the objects but also about their actual usage, which otherwise is difficult to capture using other classical sources of data such as aerial imagery. Since the GSV database is regularly updated, this allows to consequently update the landuse maps, at lower costs than those of authoritative surveys. Because every urban-object is imaged from a number of viewpoints with street-level pictures, we propose a deep-learning based architecture that accepts arbitrary number of GSV pictures to predict the fine-grained landuse classes at the object level. These classes are taken from OpenStreetMap. A quantitative evaluation of the area of Île-de-France, France shows that our model outperforms other deep learning-based methods, making it a suitable alternative to manual landuse characterization. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

The use of these typologies and finding similarities and dissimilarities between cities enables better targeted interventions for improved health, transport, and environmental outcomes in urban areas. A better understanding of local contexts can also assist in applying lessons learned from other cities. Constructing urban typologies at a global scale through traditional methods, such as functional or network analysis, requires the collection of data across multiple political districts, which can be inconsistent and then require a level of subjective classification. To overcome these limitations, we use neural networks to analyse millions of images of urban form (consisting of street view, satellite imagery, and street maps) to find shared characteristics between the largest 1692 cities in the world. The comparison city of Paris is used as an exemplar and we perform a case study using two Australian cities, Melbourne and Sydney, to determine if a “Paris-end” of town exists or can be found in these cities using these three big data imagery sets. The results show specific advantages and disadvantages of each type of imagery in constructing urban typologies. Neural networks trained with map imagery will be highly influenced by the structural mix of roads, public transport, and green and blue space. Satellite imagery captures a combination of both urban form and decorative and natural details. The use of street view imagery emphasises the features of a human-scaled visual geography of streetscapes. However, for both satellite and street view imagery to be highly effective, a reduction in scale and more aggressive pre-processing might be required in order to reduce detail and create greater abstraction in the imagery. © 2020 by the authors.","This project was made possible thanks to computer hardware purchased by the Transportation, Health, and Urban Design (THUD) Research Lab at the University of Melbourne.

The irregular and anomalous RSS values, used in a Wi-Fi indoor localization environment, cannot define the location of any unknown node correctly. Therefore, this research has developed an outlier detection technique named as iF_Ensemble for Wi-Fi indoor localization environment by analyzing RSSs using the combination of supervised, unsupervised and ensemble machine learning methods. In this research isolation forest (iForest) is used as an unsupervised learning method. Supervised learning method includes support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and random forest (RF) classifiers with stacking that is an ensemble learning method. For the evaluation purpose accuracy, precision, recall, F-score and ROC-AUC curve are used. The evaluation of used machine learning method provides high accuracy of 97.8 percent with proposed outlier detection methods and almost 2 percent improvement in the accuracy of localization process in indoor environment after eliminating outliers. © 2011 KICS.","Manuscript received December 19, 2019; revised June 1, 2020; approved for publication by Linglong Dai, Guest Editor, June 3, 2020.

This article presents an experiment that identifies cities that are similar according to their land use data. The article presents interesting preliminary experiments with screenshots of maps from the Czech map portal. After successfully working with the map samples, the study focuses on identifying cities with similar land use structures. The Copernicus European Urban Atlas 2012 was used as a source dataset (data valid years 2015-2018). The Urban Atlas freely offers land use datasets of nearly 800 functional urban areas in Europe. To search for similar cities, a set of maps detailing land use in European cities was prepared in ArcGIS. A vector of image descriptors for each map was subsequently produced using a pre-trained neural network, known as Painters, in Orange software. As a typical data mining task, the nearest neighbor function analyzes these descriptors according to land use patterns to find look-alike cities. Example city pairs based on land use are also presented in this article. The research question is whether the existing pre-trained neural network outside cartography is applicable for categorization of some thematic maps with data mining tasks such as clustering, similarity, and finding the nearest neighbor. The article's contribution is a presentation of one possible method to find cities similar to each other according to their land use patterns, structures, and shapes. Some of the findings were surprising, and without machine learning, could not have been evident through human visual investigation alone. © 2020 MDPI AG.

The paper explores how technology can be used to address the SDGs and in particular Smart Information Systems (SIS). SIS, the technologies that build on big data analytics, typically facilitated by AI techniques such as machine learning, are expected to grow in importance and impact. Some of these impacts are likely to be beneficial, notably the growth in efficiency and profits, which will contribute to societal wellbeing. At the same time, there are significant ethical concerns about the consequences of algorithmic biases, job loss, power asymmetries and surveillance, as a result of SIS use. SIS have the potential to exacerbate inequality and further entrench the market dominance of big tech companies, if left uncontrolled. Measuring the impact of SIS on SDGs thus provides a way of assessing whether an SIS or an application of such a technology is acceptable in terms of balancing foreseeable benefits and harms. One possible approach is to use the SDGs as guidelines to determine the ethical nature of SIS implementation. While the idea of using SDGs as a yardstick to measure the acceptability of emerging technologies is conceptually strong, there should be empirical evidence to support such approaches. The paper describes the findings of a set of 6 case studies of SIS across a broad range of application areas, such as smart cities, agriculture, finance, insurance and logistics, explicitly focusing on ethical issues that SIS commonly raise and empirical insights from organisations using these technologies. © 2020 by the authors.",Funding: This research was funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme Under Grant Agreement No. 786641.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087696759,Yes,Sweden,AI Ethics and Society,Policy and Ethics,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Smart Information Systems,Analysis,Explore ethical balance of using smart information systems for promoting the United Nations' sustainable development goals,"SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities; SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions",Conceptual/Theoretical,Qualitative,Global,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

Evaluating the nature and processes of these changes is key to understanding the extent to which ecological instability may be affecting sustainability futures. This study employed integrated remote sensing, GIS, land accounting techniques and utilisation of high-resolution Quickbird andWorldview 2 images to analyse actual (2008-2017) and future (2017-2030) LCC and explored implications for ecological sustainability in the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area, Ghana. After mapping and classifying actual LCC, multi-layer perception (MLP) neural network and Markov chain were employed to predict future LCC for the year 2030. The results indicate that the built-up area increased substantially from 27% in 2008 to 46% in 2017 and is expected to rise to 73% by 2030. In contrast, open-space (10%), forestlands (5%) and grassland/farmlands (49%) decreased progressively (2008-2030). In effect, these land-cover types experienced area turnover >100% during the actual and predicted period, indicating high vulnerability of natural land cover to urban growth, ecological degradation and resource depletion. The se findings highlight significant implications of LCC for ecological sustainability in the study area. A proactive land-cover/use management plan is necessary to ensure sustainable urban development and ecological land conservation. © 2020 by the authors.","Funding text 1: Acknowledgments: The authors are grateful for funding received from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).

At this point, it is very necessary to focus on making these urban areas more sustainable and greener. The need for some advanced and automated systems improves the situation, which leads to the innovation of smart cities. Smart city is the concept that helps in developing sustainable cities via optimized resource utilization methods. In smart city development, various sensing technologies can be used that can sense and utilize natural resources in better ways, like storing rainwater to use afterward, intelligent and smart control system, smart infrastructure monitoring system, smart healthcare system, smart transportation system, and smart system for energy consumption and generation by various facilities. To make the city smart and sustainable with efficient energy consumption, we propose renewable solar and wind energy-enabled hybrid heating and cooling HVAC-DHW (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning-Domestic Hot Water) system in which energy consumption is evaluated using optimized NARX-ANN and fuzzy controller based on user needs, dynamic behavior of the atmospheric environment, and spatial distribution of energy supply. To achieve the proposed goal, first, via sensor, heating and cooling effect of environment and building is sensed and these sensed inputs are then fed into deep-learning-based NARX-ANN that forecast internal building temperature. This forecasted temperature is fed into a fuzzy controller for optimizing output based on user demand. This processed information leads to energy distribution based on their requirement using a smart energy sensing system. Based on the experimentation result and performance analysis, it was found that the proposed system is more robust and has a high control response in comparison to the existing systems with minimum energy consumption. The analytical results support the feasibility of the proposed framework architecture to facilitate energy conserving in smart city buildings. © 2020 by the authors.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087342477,Yes,China,Smart Buildings,Smart Infrastructure,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Not specified,Not specified,Focus on making urban areas more sustainable and greener through smart city building construction methods,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities; SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production,Review/Survey,Qualitative,Global,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

Previous studies have generally divided study areas into several sub-areas with similar features by artificial or clustering algorithms and then developed models for these sub-areas separately using statistical methods. These approaches have drawbacks due to their subjectivity and uncertainty. In this paper, we present a study of population spatialization in Beijing City, China based on multisource remote sensing data and town-level population census data. Six predictive algorithms were compared for estimating population using the spatial variables derived from The National Polar-Orbiting Partnership/ Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP/VIIRS) night-time light and other remote sensing data. Random forest achieved the highest accuracy and therefore was employed for population spatialization. Feature selection was performed to determine the optimal variable combinations for population modeling by random forest. Cross-validation results indicated that the developed model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2129.52 people/km2 and a R2 of 0.63. The gridded population density in Beijing at a spatial resolution of 500 m produced by the random forest model was also adjusted to be consistent with the census population at the town scale. By comparison with Google Earth high-resolution images, the remotely-sensed population was qualitatively validated at the intra-town scale. Validation results indicated that remotely sensed results can effectively depict the spatial distribution of population within town-level districts. This study provides a valuable reference for urban planning, public health and disaster prevention in Beijing, and a reference for population mapping in other cities. © 2020 by the authors.","Funding text 1: Funding: This research was funded by the Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China (grant number 17YJCZH205), the Environmental Monitoring Foundation of Jiangsu Province (grant number 1903) and Qing Lan Project of Jiangsu Province (grant number R2019Q03).; Funding text 2: This research was funded by the Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China (grant number 17YJCZH205), the Environmental Monitoring Foundation of Jiangsu Province (grant number 1903) and Qing Lan Project of Jiangsu Province (grant number R2019Q03).

By leveraging the recent developments of deep learning, it gave birth to powerful algorithms for translating text from one language to another. This study aims to assess the feasibility of transferring the neural machine translation approach into a completely different context, namely human mobility and trajectory analysis. Building a conceptual parallelism between sentences (sequences of words) and motion traces (sequences of locations), we aspire to translate individual trajectories generated by a certain category of users into the corresponding mobility traces potentially generated by a different category of users. The experiment is inserted in the background of tourist mobility analysis, with the goal of translating the motion behavior of tourists belonging to a specific nationality into the motion behavior of tourists belonging to a different nationality. The model adopted is based on the seq2seq approach and consists of an encoder–decoder architecture based on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks and neural embeddings. The encoder turns an input location sequence into a corresponding hidden vector; the decoder reverses the process, turning the vector into an output location sequence. The proposed framework, tested on a real-world large-scale dataset, explores an effective attempt of motion transformation between different entities, arising as a potentially powerful source of mobility information disclosure, especially in the context of crowd management and smart city services. © 2020 by the authors.

Most EC-based solutions, from wearable devices to smart cities architectures, benefit from Machine Learning (ML) methods to perform various tasks, such as classification. In these cases, ML solutions need to deal efficiently with a huge amount of data, while balancing predictive performance, memory and time costs, and energy consumption. The fact that these data usually come in the form of a continuous and evolving data stream makes the scenario even more challenging. Many algorithms have been proposed to cope with data stream classification, e.g., Very Fast Decision Tree (VFDT) and Strict VFDT (SVFDT). Recently, Online Local Boosting (OLBoost) has also been introduced to improve predictive performance without modifying the underlying structure of the decision tree produced by these algorithms. In this work, we compared the four-way relationship among time efficiency, energy consumption, predictive performance, and memory costs, tuning the hyperparameters of VFDT and the two versions of SVFDT with and without OLBoost. Experiments over 6 benchmark datasets using an EC device revealed that VFDT and SVFDT-I were the most energy-friendly algorithms, with SVFDT-I also significantly reducing memory consumption. OLBoost, as expected, improved the predictive performance, but caused a deterioration in memory and energy consumption. © 2020 IEEE.","Manuscript received August 30, 2019; revised January 16, 2020; accepted March 24, 2020.

Social and cognitive IoT is capable of exploiting social networking characteristics to optimize network performance. Considering the fact that the IoT devices have different Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements [ranging from ultrareliable and low-latency communications (URLLCs) to minimum data rate], this article presents a QoS-driven social-aware-enhanced device-to-device (D2D) communication network model for social and cognitive IoT by utilizing social orientation information. We model the optimization problem as a multiagent reinforcement learning formulation, and a novel coordinated multiagent deep-reinforcement-learning-based resource management approach is proposed to optimize the joint radio block assignment and the transmission power control strategy. Meanwhile, the prioritized experience replay (PER) and the coordinated learning mechanisms are employed to enable communication links to work cooperatively in a distributed manner, which enhances the network performance and access success probability. The simulation results corroborate the superiority in the performance of the presented resource management approach, and it outperforms other existing approaches in terms of meeting the energy efficiency and the QoS requirements. © 2014 IEEE.","Manuscript received September 7, 2019; revised December 5, 2019, January 23, 2020, and February 26, 2020; accepted March 10, 2020.

Urbanization drives rural-to-urban migration, and inevitably promotes urban sprawl. With the development of remote sensing and geographic information technologies, the monitoring technology for urban sprawl has been constantly innovated. In particular, the emergence of night light data has greatly promoted monitoring research of large-scale and long-time-series urban sprawl. In this paper, the urban sprawl in China in 1992, 1997, 2002, 2007, 2012, and 2017 was identified via night light data, and the Artificial Neural Network-Cellular Automata-Markov (ANN-CA-Markov) model was developed to simulate the future urban sprawl in China. The results show that the suitability of urban sprawl based on the ANN model is as high as 0.864, indicating that the ANN model is very suitable for the simulation of urban sprawl. The Kappa coefficient of simulation results was 0.78, indicating that the ANN-CA-Markov model has a high simulation accuracy on urban sprawl. In the future, the hotspot areas of urban sprawl in China will change over time. Although the urban sprawl in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Yangtze River delta, and the Pearl River delta will still be considerable, the urban sprawl in the Chengdu-Chongqing city cluster, the Guanzhong Plain city cluster, the central plains city cluster, and the middle reaches of the Yangtze River will be more prominent. Overall, China's urban sprawl will be concentrated in the east of Hu's line in the future. © 2020 by the authors.

Although urbanization leads to great social and economic progress, they may be confronted with other issues, including extra heat and air pollution. Local climate zone (LCZ), a new concept developed for urban heat island research, provides a standard classification system for the urban environment. LCZs are defined by the context of the urban environment; the minimum diameter of an LCZ is expected to be 400–1,000 m so that it can have a valid effect on the urban climate. However, most existing methods (e.g., the WUDAPT method) regard this task as pixel-based classification, neglecting the spatial information. In this study, we argue that LCZ mapping should be considered as a scene classification task to fully exploit the environmental context. Fifteen cities covering 138 million population in three economic regions of China are selected as the study area. Sentinel-2 multispectral data with a 10 m spatial resolution are used to classify LCZs. A deep convolutional neural network composed of residual learning and the Squeeze-and-Excitation block, namely the LCZNet, is proposed. We obtained an overall accuracy of 88.61% by using a large image (48×48 corresponding to 480×480 m2) as the representation of an LCZ, 7.5% higher than that using a small image representation (10×10) and nearly 20% higher than that obtained by the standard WUDAPT method. Image sizes from 32×32 to 64×64 were found suitable for LCZ mapping, while a deeper network achieved better classification with larger inputs. Compared with natural classes, urban classes benefited more from a large input size, as it can exploit the environment context of urban areas. The combined use of the training data from all three regions led to the best classification, but the transfer of LCZ models cannot achieve satisfactory results due to the domain shift. More advanced domain adaptation methods should be applied in this application. © 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

In this paper, we analyze the impact of 5G on both traditional and emerging technologies and project our view on future research challenges and opportunities. With a predicted increase of 10-100x in bandwidth and 5-10x decrease in latency, 5G is expected to be the main enabler for smart cities, smart IoT and efficient healthcare, where machine learning is conducted at the edge. In this context, we investigate how 5G can help the development of federated learning. Network slicing, another key feature of 5G, allows running multiple isolated networks on the same physical infrastructure. However, security remains the main concern in the context of virtualization, multi-tenancy and high device density. Formal verification of 5G networks can be applied to detect security issues in massive virtualized environments. In summary, 5G will make the world even more densely and closely connected.

The emergence of deep learning has greatly promoted the development of anomaly detection and much remarkable work has been presented on this topic. However, the existing approaches for anomaly detection generally encounter problems such as insufficient utilization of motion patterns and instability on different datasets. To improve the performance of anomaly detection in surveillance video, we propose a framework based on bidirectional prediction, which predicts the same target frame by the forward and the backward prediction subnetworks, respectively. Then the loss function is constructed based on the real target frame and its bidirectional prediction frame. Furthermore, we also propose an anomaly score estimation method based on the sliding window scheme which focuses on the foregrounds of the prediction error map. The comparison with the state-of-the-art shows that the proposed model outperforms most competing models on different video surveillance datasets. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant U1613214 and the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2018YFB1404101 .,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083881924,Yes,China,Public Safety and Security,Urban Safety,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"Deep Learning, Bidirectional Prediction",Anomaly Detection,Detect abnormal behaviors in surveillance video automatically using deep learning for public security and smart city,"SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities; SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Weak

In our paper, particulate matter less than 2.5 μm (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) air pollution data obtained by community scientists while cycling is used to develop high-resolution spatial air pollution maps. Mapping is completed using a land use regression model for Charlotte, North Carolina. The air pollution observations were obtained with a low-cost sensor. We evaluated the accuracy of the sensor through a collocation study for 3203 h, which identified the sensor had a mean bias of 7.25 μg/m3 and a correlation of r = 0.77 with an US EPA Federal Equivalent Monitor. A machine learning model was developed to adjust the sensor observations, which demonstrated their highest errors during periods of high humidity. The adjustment was able to reduce the root mean squared error from 12 μg/m3 to 3.8 μg/m3, and the mean bias was reduced to −0.5 μg/m3. Cycling times were not balanced throughout the day nor the year. We applied a temporal adjustment algorithm to account for this imbalance in observation periods with the intention of producing long-term estimates representing the sampling period of 2016 and 2017. The long-term air pollution surface for the city was generated with a land use regression model. Both linear regression and machine learning approaches were applied. The linear regression model performed poorly with a training R2 of 0.15 and a cross-validation R2 of 0.15. A stacked ensemble model was developed using machine learning, which had a training 5-fold cross-validation mean residual deviance of 3.82 μg/m3, a root mean squared error of 1.95 μg/m3, and a mean absolute error of 0.95 μg/m3.

However, one fundamental limitation of a Cloud is the connectivity with end devices. Fog computing overcomes this limitation and supports the requirements of time-sensitive applications by distributing computation, communication, and storage services along the Cloud to Things (C2T) continuum, empowering potential new applications, such as smart cities, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR). However, the adoption of Fog-based computational resources and their integration with the Cloud introduces new challenges in resource management, which requires the implementation of new strategies to guarantee compliance with the quality of service (QoS) requirements of applications. In this context, one major question is how to map the QoS requirements of applications on Fog and Cloud resources. One possible approach is to discriminate the applications arriving at the Fog into Classes of Service (CoS). This paper thus introduces a set of CoS for Fog applications which includes, the QoS requirements that best characterize these Fog applications. Moreover, this paper proposes the implementation of a typical machine learning classification methodology to discriminate Fog computing applications as a function of their QoS requirements. Furthermore, the application of this methodology is illustrated in the assessment of classifiers in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness to noise. The adoption of a methodology for machine learning-based classification constitutes a first step towards the definition of QoS provisioning mechanisms in Fog computing. Moreover, classifying Fog computing applications can facilitate the decision-making process for Fog scheduler. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Brazilian National Research Agency CNPq and the Academy of Sciences for the Developing World ( TWAS ), under process 190172/2014-2 of the CNPq- TWAS program.

One of the key challenges of modelling these interactions is to understand and model how human individuals make and develop their location decisions by learning that then shape urban land-use patterns. To investigate this issue, we have constructed an extended experience-weighted attraction learning model to represent the human agents’ learning when they make location decisions. Consequently, we propose and have developed an agent-based learning-embedded model (ABM-learning) for residential land growth simulation that incorporates a learning model, a decision-making model, a land use conversion model and the constraint of urban land use master plan. The proposed model was used for a simulation of the residential land growth in Shenzhen city, China. By validating the model against empirical data, the results showed that the site-specific accuracy of the model has been improved when embedding learning model. The analysis on the simulation accuracies has proved the argument that modelling individual-level learning matters in the agent's decision model and the agent-based models. We also applied the model to predict residential land growth in Shenzhen from 2015 to 2035, and the result can be a reference for land-use allocation in detailed planning of Shenzhen. The ABM-learning is applicable to studying the past urban growth trajectory, aiding in the formulation of detailed residential land and public service facility planning and assessing the land use planning effectiveness. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","This research was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant number: 2017YFB0504205 ), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant number: 41671386 ).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082106345,Yes,China,Land Use,Urban Planning,Urban Development & Land Use,"Agent-based Modeling, Machine Learning",Simulation,Develop an agent-based learning-embedded model for urban land use planning with case study of residential land growth in Shenzhen,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Longitudinal,Strong

Sustainable urban development requires a better understanding of the impacts of urban growth on ecosystems. We selected Guangzhou City to analyze the impacts of urban development processes and urban geographic changes on NPP, as well as the correlation between urbanization intensity and NPP, using a deep-learning urbanization characteristic index (UCI). The results showed that the NPP in the study area had clear spatial heterogeneity and declined overall from 2001 to 2013. Guangzhou’s urbanization became more and more intense, the mean UCI increased significantly from 0.1293 in 2001 to 0.2879 in 2013, and urban geographic type was dominated by urban exurbs in 2001 and 2013 while urban fringe areas increased most significantly and about 2,320.24 km2 of urban exurbs were converted to urban fringes. There was a significant negative correlation between UCI and NPP in 2001 and 2013, implying that NPP had been negatively influenced by the increasing urban development intensity. The transition of urban exurbs to urban fringes was associated with the highest NPP losses, which was caused by cropland loss and built-up land expansion. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61806059, 41671430), the Guangdong Province Science and Technology Plan Project (2018A030310069), and NSFC-Guangdong Joint Foundation Key Project (U1901219).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081742503,Yes,China,Urban Climate,Environmental Quality,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Remote Sensing Analysis,Measurement/Analysis,Analyze dynamic changes of net primary productivity and associated urban growth driving forces in Guangzhou City,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities; SDG 13: Climate Action,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Past,Longitudinal,Strong

These factors elevate the urban–rural air temperature (T<inf>a</inf>) difference, thus generating the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon. T<inf>a</inf> is used in the fields of public health and epidemiology to quantify deaths attributable to heat in cities around the world: the presence of UHI can exacerbate exposure to high temperatures during summer periods, thereby increasing the risk of heat-related mortality. Measuring and monitoring the spatial patterns of T<inf>a</inf> in urban contexts is challenging due to the lack of a good network of weather stations. This study aims to produce a parsimonious model to retrieve maximum T<inf>a</inf> (T<inf>max</inf>) at high spatio-temporal resolution using Earth Observation (EO) satellite data. The novelty of this work is twofold: (i) it will produce daily estimations of T<inf>max</inf> for London at 1 km2 during the summertime between 2006 and 2017 using advanced statistical techniques and satellite-derived predictors, and (ii) it will investigate for the first time the predictive power of the gradient boosting algorithm to estimate T<inf>max</inf> for an urban area. In this work, 6 regression models were calibrated with 6 satellite products, 3 geospatial features, and 29 meteorological stations. Stepwise linear regression was applied to create 9 groups of predictors, which were trained and tested on each regression method. This study demonstrates the potential of machine learning algorithms to predict T<inf>max</inf>: the gradient boosting model with a group of five predictors (land surface temperature, Julian day, normalised difference vegetation index, digital elevation model, solar zenith angle) was the regression model with the best performance (R² = 0.68, MAE = 1.60 °C, and RMSE = 2.03 °C). This methodological approach is capable of being replicated in other UK cities, benefiting national heat-related mortality assessments since the data (provided by NASA and the UK Met Office) and programming languages (Python) sources are free and open. This study provides a framework to produce a high spatio-temporal resolution of T<inf>max</inf>, assisting public health researchers to improve the estimation of mortality attributable to high temperatures. In addition, the research contributes to practice and policy-making by enhancing the understanding of the locations where mortality rates may increase due to heat. Therefore, it enables a more informed decision-making process towards the prioritisation of actions to mitigate heat-related mortality amongst the vulnerable population. © 2020 The Author","The author is grateful for the support received from the Brazilian research agency CNPq (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development).

The recognition of suspicious events is important in both indoor and outdoor environments, such as child-care centers, smart-homes, old-age homes, residential areas, office environments, elevators, and smart cities. Environmental audio scene and sound event recognition are the fundamental tasks involved in many audio surveillance applications. Although numerous approaches have been proposed, robust environmental audio surveillance remains a huge challenge due to various reasons, such as various types of overlapping audio sounds, background noises, and lack of universal and multi-modal datasets. The goal of this article is to review various features of representing audio scenes and sound events and provide appropriate machine learning algorithms for audio surveillance tasks. Benchmark datasets are categorized based on the real-world scenarios of audio surveillance applications. To have a quantitative understanding, some of the state-of-the-art approaches are evaluated based on two benchmark datasets for audio scenes and sound event recognition tasks. Finally, we outline the possible future directions for improving the recognition of environmental audio scenes and sound events. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","The authors acknowledged the support of research grant from Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, under the scheme, Cognitive Science Research Initiative, grant number DST/CSRI/2017/131.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078984426,Yes,India,Public Safety and Security,Urban Safety,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Audio Recognition,Classification,Survey environmental audio scene and sound event recognition for autonomous surveillance applications,"SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities; SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions",Review/Survey,Qualitative,Global,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

The number of passengers in the buses or at the stations is necessary for making an optimal scheduling policy of public buses. We develop a crowd counting algorithm to provide the counting information for a bus dispatch system in a human–machine system. In consideration of the challenges (e.g., pedestrian occlusions, non-uniform crowd distributions, and scale variations) existed in hand-crafted features based crowd counting, a scale-distribution-aware multi-column convolutional neural network (SDA-MCNN) is presented to count crowds by summing up the output (denoted as the density map) of the SDA-MCNN. The SDA-MCNN is robust to scale variations by processing a crowd image with multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) columns and minimizing the per-scale loss. A weighted Euclidean loss is proposed to handle non-uniform crowd distributions. The loss can increase activations in dense regions and restrain activations in backgrounds. A new approach to estimate perspective maps of dense crowds is put forward to offer necessary information for generating density maps with human-shaped kernels. Evaluations on benchmarks are performed with other state-of-the-art counting approaches using deep neural networks. Comparative results verify the accuracy of our counting approach in challenging crowds. Evaluations on the real world BUS data reveal the accuracy of the proposed approach in counting passengers in spite of the complex environment. © 2019","This work has been supported by the National key R&D program 2018AAA0100800 , the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61703381 , the Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China under Grant No. 18KJB520003 , was supported in part by the Key Research and Development Program of Jiangsu under grants BE2017071, BE2017647 and BE2018004-04 , the Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics , Southeast University under grant 2019005 , and the State Key Laboratory of Integrated Management of Pest Insects and Rodents under grant IPM1914 .

However, owing to the volatility and intermittency of RE, it is challenging to design an accurate and reliable short-term load forecasting model. Recently, machine learning (ML) based forecasting models have been applied for short-term load forecasting whereas most of them ignore the importance of characteristics mining, parameters fine-tuning, and forecasting stability. To dissolve the above issues, a short-term load forecasting model is proposed that incorporates thorough data mining and multi-step rolling forecasting. To alleviate the chaos of short-term load, a de-noising method based on decomposition and reconstruction is used. Then, a phase space reconstruction (PSR) method is employed to dynamically determine the train-test ratios and neurons settings of the artificial neural network (ANN). Further, a multi-objective grasshopper optimization algorithm (MOGOA) is applied to optimize the parameters of ANNs. Case studies are conducted in the urban smart grid systems of Victoria and New South Wales in Australia. Simulation results show that the proposed model can forecast short-term load well with various measurement metrics. Multiple criterion and statistical evaluation also show the good performance of the proposed forecasting model in terms of accuracy and stability. To conclude, the proposed model achieves high accuracy and robustness, which will provide references to RE transitions and smart grid optimization, and offer guidance to sustainable city development. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",China Scholarship Council (CSC) is gratefully acknowledged for its support to Chen Li (file No. 201908210319 ).,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082196590,Yes,Netherlands,Energy and Utilities,Smart Infrastructure,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Machine Learning,Prediction/Forecasting,Design an accurate and reliable short-term load forecasting model for urban smart grid system with renewable energy,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy; SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

Therefore, undertaking risk studies of urban floods, especially the depth prediction of urban flood is very important for urban flood control. In this study, an urban flood data warehouse was established with available structured and unstructured urban flood data. In this study, an urban flood data warehouse was established with available structured and unstructured urban flood data. Based on this, a regression model to predict the depth of urban flooded areas was constructed with deep learning algorithm, named Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT). The flood condition factors used in modeling were rainfall, rainfall duration, peak rainfall, evaporation, land use (the proportion of roads, woodlands, grasslands, water bodies and building), permeability, catchment area, and slope. Based on the rainfall data of different rainfall return periods, flood condition maps were produced using GIS. In addition, the feature importance of these conditioning factors was determined based on the regression model. The results demonstrated that the growth rate of the number and depth of the water accumulation points increased significantly after the rainfall return period of ‘once in every two years’ in Zhengzhou City, and the flooded areas mainly occurred in the old urban areas and parts of southern Zhengzhou. The relative error of prediction results was 11.52%, which verifies the applicability and validity of the method in the depth prediction of urban floods.

We do expect more out of ‘intelligent systems’ than we do from ‘smart materials’. One of the more fascinating aspects of today’s society is how ‘techno-speak’ terms come into existence and assume currency without universal agreement about what is actually meant. There has been a lot of recent interest in ‘intelligent rooms’ and ‘intelligent buildings’ without a clear consensus about what is actually meant by these terms. The parallel question raised of whether common rooms or buildings are ‘dumb’ is equally interesting, particularly since architects and builders have done rather well at responding to societal and cultural needs for millennia. This paper is an attempt to bring the difference between construction techniques of smart application with intelligent materials to act as sustainable challenge to construction methods .Dependence on technology instead of architectural solutions have need analysed taking an example of a Modern Building in Dubai with upcoming equivalent construction in Bhopal under the scheme of Smart cities. A modern smart building is selected for the case study, and design parameters are compared with the technical installations in the building to make it smart. The methodology used is to observe the environmental, economical, sustainable and resource depletion factors in the construction, use and maintenance of the building for its life span and even after that. The comparative analysis of energy consumed, health affected, resource depletion and others bring out the real correlation of Smart vs intelligence. Conclusions show that Architectural education is avoided in designing, selecting constructing and analysing the use, life, purpose and consumption of the construction as well as maintenance materials all together.

Recently, an increasing number of sensors installed in parking spaces have provided big spatio-temporal data that be used to analyze parking situations in the city and help parking officers monitor parking violations. The traveling officer problem was customized to formulate a path-finding problem that aims to maximize the probability of catching overstayed cars before they leave. One of the challenges is to extract effective features from the big spatio-temporal data and provide a data-driven solution to replace conventional solutions such as a simple rule-based system or single optimization methods. In this article, we propose a seamless end-to-end learning and optimization framework that combines the long short-term memory auto-encoder neural network, clustering, and path-finding methods to solve the traveling officer problem.

Ubiquitous geo-location, localization technology, and availability of big-data-ready computing infrastructure have enabled the development of more sophisticated models to characterize human mobility in urban areas. In this work, our main goal is to extract spatio-temporal features that characterize user mobility and, based on the similarity of these features, identify user communities. To this end, we propose a novel approach that leverages image processing techniques to represent user geographical preferences as images and then apply deep convolutional autoencoders to extract latent spatio-temporal mobility features from these images. These features are then fed to a clustering algorithm that identifies the underlying community structures. We use a diverse urban mobility dataset to validate the proposed framework. Our results show that the proposed framework is able to significantly increase the similarity between intra-community nodes (by up to 107%) as well as dissimilarity between inter-community nodes (up to 54%) when compared against no pre-processing of the datasets, i.e without pre-processing the datasets through any feature fusion method. Moreover, it was also able to reach up to 100% improvement when compared against community identification using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Our results also show that the proposed approach yields significant increase in contact time amongst users belonging to the same community, by up to 80% when compared to the average contact time when not considering community structures, and by up to 150% when compared to the baseline. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first to consider deep convolutional autoencoding to perform automatic extraction of non-linear spatio-temporal mobility features characterizing individual users from raw mobility datasets with the goal of identifying user communities. © 2020 ACM.","This work was partially supported by grant CNS 1321151 from the US National Science Foundation and by the Coordenaçao de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior - Brasil (CAPES) - Finance Code 001.

In this paper, we make use of an urban land use survey to obtain a complete sample set of a city, test the impact of different training and validation sample sizes on the accuracy, and summarize the sampling strategy. The following conclusions are drawn based on our systematic analysis in Shenzhen. (1) For the best classification accuracy, the number of training samples should be no less than 40% of the total number of parcels or no less than 5500 parcels. For the best labor cost performance, the number should be no less than 7% or no less than 900. (2) The accuracy evaluation is stable and reliable and requires validation sample numbers of no less than 10% of the total or no less than 1200. (3) Samples with a purity of 60-90% are preferred, and the classification effectiveness is better in samples with a purity greater than 90% under the same number. (4) If spatial equilibrium sampling cannot be carried out, sampling areas with complex land use patterns should be preferred. © 2020 by the authors.",Acknowledgments: This research was supported by the Shenzhen Urban Planning and Land Resource Research Center.

To mitigate the impact of climate change, several sustainability-oriented large-scale infrastructure projects such as electric road systems and expanding rail systems have recently been on the policy agenda. A parallel development that is expected to accelerate the transition of the transport sector is digitalization, which, although ongoing for many decades, has recently been augmented by concepts such as artificial intelligence (AI) and smart city technologies. The integration of these digitalization tools at the organizational level poses not only opportunities but also some challenges for the actors involved in infrastructure projects. An approach that is currently promoted in the infrastructure sector is the Building Information Model (BIM), which is a decision-making instrument that leverages various digitalization tools and applications. However, although the economic implications of BIM are widely discussed in the literature, the (inter-) organizational dynamics involving multiple actors in infrastructure projects are not fully grasped. Large infrastructure projects are sociotechnical endeavors embedded in complex institutional frames; hence the institutional norms, practices and logics in them are significant. Responding to this, this paper adopted an institutional analysis and put the BIM approach in the (inter-) organizational context in infrastructure delivery. Drawing on empirical data from three organizations in infrastructure delivery in Spain, this paper analyzed the tensions among actors during BIM adoption and implementation. © 2020 by the authors.","Funding text 1: Acknowledgments: This paper was produced as part of the EMJD Programme European Doctorate in Industrial Management (EDIM) funded by the European Commission, Erasmus Mundus Action 1.

In this study, we developed and successfully applied methodologies that rely heavily on readily available temporal, visible, and near-infrared radar and thermal remote sensing data sets and field data, as well as statistical approaches to map the distribution of shallow (1-5 m deep) groundwater occurrences in Al Qunfudah Province, Saudi Arabia, and to identify the factors controlling their development. A four-fold approach was adopted: (1) constructing a digital database to host relevant geologic, hydrogeologic, topographic, land use, climatic, and remote sensing data sets, (2) identifying the distribution of areas characterized by shallow groundwater levels, (3) developing conceptual and statistical models to map the distribution of shallow groundwater occurrences, and (4) constructing an artificial neural network (ANN) and multivariate regression (MR) models to map the distribution of shallow groundwater, test the models over areas of known depth to groundwater (area of Al Qunfudah city and surroundings: 294 km2), and apply the better of the two models to map the shallow groundwater occurrences across the entire Al Qunfudah Province (area: 4680 km2). Findings include: (1) high performance for the ANN (92%) and MR (88%) models in predicting the distribution of shallow groundwater using temporal-derived remote sensing products (e.g., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), radar backscatter coefficient, precipitation, and brightness temperature) and field data (depth to water table), (2) areas witnessing shallow groundwater levels show high NDVI (mean and standard deviation (STD), radar backscatter coefficient values (mean and STD), and low brightness temperature (mean and STD) compared to their surroundings, (3) correlations of temporal groundwater levels and satellite-based precipitation suggest that the observed (2017-2019) rise in groundwater levels is related to an increase in precipitation in these years compared to the previous three years (2014-2016), and (4) the adopted methodologies are reliable, cost-effective, and could potentially be applied to identify shallow groundwater along the Red Sea Hills and in similar settings worldwide. © 2020 by the authors.","Funding text 1: Funding: This research was funded by King Saud University, the Saudi Arabian Cultural Mission to the US, and Earth Sciences Remote Sensing Facility at Western Michigan University.; Funding text 2: This research was funded by King Saud University, the Saudi Arabian Cultural Mission to the US, and Earth Sciences Remote Sensing Facility at Western Michigan University.

To solve these traffic problems, the development of intelligent transportation systems are accelerated in many cities. While vehicles and their detailed information detection are great significance to the development of urban intelligent transportation system, the traditional vehicle detection algorithm is not satisfactory in the case of complex environment and high real-time requirement. The vehicle detection algorithm based on motion information is unable to detect the stationary vehicles in video. At present, the application of deep learning method in the task of target detection effectively improves the existing problems in traditional algorithms. However, there are few dataset for vehicles detailed information, i.e. driver, car inspection sign, copilot, plate and vehicle object, which are key information for intelligent transportation. This paper constructs a deep learning dataset containing 10,000 representative images about vehicles and their key information detection. Then, the SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) target detection algorithm is improved and the improved algorithm is applied to the video surveillance system. The detection accuracy of small targets is improved by adding deconvolution modules to the detection network. The experimental results show that the proposed method can detect the vehicle, driver, car inspection sign, copilot and plate, which are vehicle key information, at the same time, and the improved algorithm in this paper has achieved better results in the accuracy and real-time performance of video surveillance than the SSD algorithm. © © 2020 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.",Funding: This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 61401455 and 41801241).,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084943628,Yes,China,Transportation,Urban Mobility,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector),Object Detection,Develop vehicle key information detection algorithm based on improved SSD for intelligent transportation systems,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

However, even though the rise of unplanned development influences planning and management of residential land-use, reliable and detailed information about these areas is often scarce. While formal settlements in urban areas are easily mapped due to their distinct features, this does not hold true for informal settlements because of their microstructure, instability, and variability of shape and texture. Therefore, detecting and mapping these areas remains a challenging task. This research will contribute to the development of tools to identify such informal built-up areas by using an integrated approach of multiscale deep learning. The authors propose a composite architecture for semantic segmentation using the U-net architecture aided by information obtained from a multiscale contourlet transform. This work also analyzes the effects of wavelet and contourlet decompositions in the U-net architecture. The performance was evaluated in terms of precision, recall, F-score, mean intersection over union, and overall accuracy.

This study presents a reliable method that reveals the structure of cities mainly based on clustering analysis using a new similarity measure. Several previous studies have used well-known clustering algorithms in machine learning fields, such as k-means clustering based on temporal mobility patterns of regions, whereas other studies have applied community detection algorithms on networks that depict traffic flows. However, the former does not reflect spatial interactions among places or areas, and the latter groups' places or areas with different land uses into the same cluster. To address these issues in existing approaches, this study proposes a new similarity method that considers not only temporal mobility patterns of areas but also spatial interactions with other areas. Moreover, the study combines spectral clustering repeated several times with hierarchical clustering to obtain a reliable structure that keeps the contiguity of clusters and determine the hierarchy of different areal units. The application of the proposed method to the data for Seoul, South Korea, reveals that the proposed clustering process divides a city into relatively homogeneous areas in terms of land uses. The flow maps based on the clustering results also revealed the spatial interactions between different areas and identify the polycentric structure of Seoul. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Manuscript received March 8, 2018; revised August 30, 2018, March 14, 2019 and April 4, 2019; accepted April 8, 2019.

This study evaluates three unsupervised methods of segmenting urban vegetation: clustering with k-means using k-means++ seeding; clustering with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM); and an unsupervised, backpropagating convolutional neural network (CNN) with simple iterative linear clustering superpixels. When benchmarked against internal validity metrics and hand-coded data, k-means is more accurate than GMM and CNN in segmenting urban vegetation. K-means is not able to differentiate between water and shadows, however, and when this segment is important GMM is best for probabilistically identifying secondary land cover class membership. Though we find the unsupervised CNN shows high degrees of accuracy on built urban landscape features, its accuracy when segmenting vegetation does not justify its complexity. Despite limitations, for segmenting urban vegetation, k-means has the highest performance, is the simplest, and is more efficient than alternatives. © 2020 Lassiter, Darbari.

Traditional mobility prediction based optimisation and encryption approaches are reactive in nature; however, Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven proactive solutions are required for near real-time optimisation. Leveraging the historical passenger data recorded via Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) sensors installed at the train stations, mobility prediction models can be developed to support and improve the railway operational performance vis-a-vis 5G and beyond. In this paper we have analysed the passenger traffic flows based on an Access, Egress and Interchange (AEI) framework to support train infrastructure against congestion, accidents, overloading carriages and maintenance. This paper predominantly focuses on developing passenger flow predictions using Machine Learning (ML) along with a novel encryption model that is capable of handling the heavy passenger traffic flow in real-time. We have compared and reported the performance of various ML driven flow prediction models using real-world passenger flow data obtained from London Underground and Overground (LUO). Extensive spatio-temporal simulations leveraging realistic mobility prediction models show that an AEI framework can achieve 91.17% prediction accuracy along with secure and light-weight encryption capabilities. Security parameters such as correlation coefficient (<0.01), entropy (>7.70), number of pixel change rate (>99%), unified average change intensity (>33), contrast (>10), homogeneity (<0.3) and energy (<0.01) prove the efficacy of the proposed encryption scheme. © 2020 by the authors.

The trust information in surveillance data motivates the analysis of images from numerous IoT devices. Saliency detection is a fundamental step in surveillance data analysis for providing help to the subsequent tasks, but unsuitable to IoT applications owing to the neglect of image similarity and difference from diverse IoT devices. To solve this problem, we enable the co-saliency detection in IoT, which detects the common and salient foreground regions in the group surveillance images. The main contributions include: 1) enable a multistage context perception scheme to efficiently extract the contextual information corresponding to different-size receptive fields in the single image; 2) construct a two-path information propagation to extract the interimage similarity and difference from the high-level image feature representations of the group images; and 3) propose the stage-wise refinement to allocate the label information to different parts of the network for helping the network to learn the enriched semantically common knowledge. The extensive experiments performed on three public data sets can demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and its superiority to four state-of-the-art co-saliency detection methods. © 2014 IEEE.","Funding text 1: Manuscript received July 20, 2019; revised December 13, 2019; accepted December 16, 2019.

It is sample-inefficient to train separate models per domain, which motivates learning a single model from multiple sources. For example, the local climate zone (LCZ) classification problem that aims to produce per-pixel classifications of surface structure from remotely sensed images of urban and rural environments. These classification maps need to be generated for different cities at different times. To do this efficiently, available training data from different sources (i.e., cities) must be adapted for the task at hand. However, multisource domain adaptation (MDA) is a challenging problem and is particularly apparent when there are significant changes in the data distribution among these sources. In this article, we propose a scalable yet simple adaptive MDA (AMDA) framework to address this problem. AMDA is also capable of dealing with imbalanced data distributions among the sources more effectively than existing baselines. We also extend two techniques originally proposed for domain expansion (DE) to the task of DA. AMDA and the extended DE techniques are implemented and evaluated on the LCZ classification problem. Despite its simplicity, AMDA is able to achieve more than 12% improvement over the baseline. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Manuscript received April 18, 2019; revised October 10, 2019; accepted November 4, 2019.

The city of Guwahati, a million city in north east India, has expanded significantly in recent years. In this article, the links between population and growth of built-up areas were examined using geo-spatial techniques and remotely sensed datasets. The results indicate that the sprawl has accentuated in recent years. The intensity of land use remained uneven due to marked variations in the distribution of built-up areas, plausibly an outcome of unplanned urban growth.

DTs integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics to create living digital simulation models that are able to learn and update from multiple sources as well as represent and predict the current and future conditions of physical counterparts. However, current activities related to DTs are still at an early stage with respect to buildings and other infrastructure assets from an architectural and engineering/construction point of view. Less attention has been paid to the operation and maintenance (O&M) phase, which is the longest time span in the asset life cycle. A systematic and clear architecture verified with practical use cases for constructing a DT would be the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of buildings and cities. According to current research about multitier architectures, this paper presents a system architecture for DTs that is specifically designed at both the building and city levels. Based on this architecture, a DT demonstrator of the West Cambridge site of the University of Cambridge in the UK was developed that integrates heterogeneous data sources, supports effective data querying and analysis, supports decision-making processes in O&M management, and further bridges the gap between human relationships with buildings/cities.

While these city-level factors help to improve the quality of distance approximation functions for city-wide vehicle movements, more granular factors are needed to obtain accurate shortest path distance approximations for last-mile transportation systems that are typically characterized by local trips. More importantly, local circuity factors encode valuable information about the efficiency and complexity of the urban road network, which can be leveraged to inform policy and practice. In this paper, we quantify and analyze local network circuity leveraging contemporary traffic datasets. Using the city of São Paulo as our primary case study and a combination of supervised and un-supervised machine learning methods, we observe significant heterogeneities in local network circuity, explained by dimensional and topological properties of the road network. Locally, real trip distances are about twice as long as distances predicted by the L<inf>1</inf> norm. Results from São Paulo are compared to seven additional urban areas in Latin America and the United States. At a coarse-grained level of analysis, we observe similar correlations between road network properties and local circuity across these cities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081130115,Yes,United States,Transportation,Urban Mobility,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Network Analysis,Measurement/Analysis,Quantify the impact of urban road networks on the efficiency of local trips through more granular circuity factors,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Global,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

Due to the complex socioeconomic nature of functional land use, recognizing urban region function in high-density cities using remote sensing images alone is difficult. The inclusion of social sensing has the potential to improve the function classification performance. However, effectively integrating the multi-source and multi-modal remote and social sensing data remains technically challenging. In this paper, we have proposed a novel end-to-end deep learning-based remote and social sensing data fusion model to address this issue. Two neural network based methods, one based on a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) and the other based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, have been developed to automatically extract discriminative time-dependent social sensing signature features, which are fused with remote sensing image features extracted via a residual neural network. One of the major difficulties in exploiting social and remote sensing data is that the two data sources are asynchronous. We have developed a deep learning-based strategy to address this missing modality problem by enforcing cross-modal feature consistency (CMFC) and cross-modal triplet (CMT) constraints. We train the model in an end-to-end manner by simultaneously optimizing three costs, including the classification cost, the CMFC cost and the CMT cost. Extensive experiments have been conducted on publicly available datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in fusing remote and social sensing data for urban region function recognition. The results show that the seemingly unrelated physically sensed image data and social activities sensed signatures can indeed complement each other to help enhance the accuracy of urban region function recognition. © 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

However, either the training sample shortage or the error accumulation in the multi-temporal processing inevitably restricts the monitoring performance. In this paper, to overcome these problems, we present a label-noise robust active learning method, which automatically collects reliable and informative samples from the images and builds a unified classification system with these augmented samples. In more detail, a Bayesian sample collection process that fuses the unsupervised transition information and the multi-temporal land-cover information is designed to provide candidate samples with “from-to” labels. A reliability-based multi-classifier active learning method is then proposed to adaptively allocate the more reliable samples to the classes that are difficulty to classify. Finally, a fusion of the multiple multi-date classifications trained by the selected samples is implemented to identify the change type of interest. The dynamic monitoring results for Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Shiyan in China, two megacities with rapid and obvious urbanization and a small city with relatively slow urbanization, indicate that the proposed method achieves a significantly higher accuracy than the current state-of-the art methods. The sample accuracy verified by the high spatial resolution reference maps endorses the applicability of the sample collection, while the reliability-based active learning further ensures the robustness of the proposed method in the label-noise situation. The presented method was tested in two difficult situations (a small training sample case and a training sample set without joint labeling), so that the robustness and accuracy of the approach can be expected to be of a similar or better quality in cases with more training samples. Given its effectiveness and robustness, the proposed method could be widely applied in LULC change dynamic monitoring. © 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

In this context, finding an unoccupied parking slot by the interested vehicle owners with least overhead becomes an NP-Hard problem bounded by various constraints. In-advance availability of information regarding parking occupancy plays a major role in hassle free trip optimization for motorists. It also facilitates services-cum-profit management for the parking owners. It further helps in curbing congestion by reducing cruising time and hence, helps in controlling pollution of the smart cities. Thus, accurate and timely information regarding parking occupancy and availability has become the basic need in the evolution of the smart cities. Motivated by these facts, an occupancy-driven machine learning based on-street parking pricing scheme is proposed in this paper. The proposed scheme uses machine learning based approaches to predict occupancy of parking lots, which in turn is used to deduce occupancy driven prices for arriving vehicles. In order to train, test, and compare different machine learning models, on-street parking data of Seattle city has been used. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that parking occupancy prediction system is used to generate occupancy based parking prices for on-street parking system of the Seattle city. Results obtained using the proposed occupancy driven machine learning based on-street parking pricing scheme demonstrate its effectiveness over other existing state-of-the-art schemes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Funding text 1: Prof. Seema Bawa received the Ph.D. degree in computer science and engineering from Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology Patiala, Punjab, India.

Understanding the influence of social features on crime occurrences of a city is a hot topic among researchers. Correlations between crime and other social characteristics have been studied by large amounts of statistical models, including Ordinary Least Square (OLS) linear regression model, Random Forest (RF) regression model, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model and so on. However, results of these studies, such as the prediction accuracy, are not satisfying and many contradictory conclusions are achieved in previous research works. These controversies are triggered by several factors, including the non-Gaussian distributions and multicollinearity of urban social data, inaccuracy and inadequacy of the processed data, etc. To fill these gaps, we analyzed the influence of 18 urban indicators within 6 categories including geography, economy, education, housing, urbanization and population structure on crime risk in China's major prefecture-level cities by year. We used the big data algorithm, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Extremely-randomized Trees (Extra-Trees), to predict the crime risk and quantify the influence of urban parameters on crime. 83% of accuracy on crime risk prediction can be obtained from our fitted model and the importance of urban indicators is ranked. Results show that area of land used for living, number of subscribers of mobile telephone, employed population are the three main factors on the crime occurrences in China. Our research makes contributions to better understanding of the effects of urban indicators on crime in a socialist nation, and providing instructions and strategies for crime prediction and crime rate control with governments, in this big-data era. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Funding text 1: We are grateful for the support provided by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFC0803800) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71573154 and No. 71790610).; Funding text 2: We are grateful for the support provided by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFC0803800 ) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71573154 and No. 71790610 ).,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076225265,Yes,China,Public Safety and Security,Urban Safety,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"Big Data Algorithm, Gradient Boosting Machine",Prediction/Forecasting,Analyze crime risk through big data algorithm with urban metrics to understand influence of social features on crime,"SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities; SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

With the development and advancement of computer technology, the emergence of intelligent transportation provides a better way to solve the problem of effectively alleviating traffic pressure and reducing the incidence of traffic accidents. In recent years, intelligent traffic monitoring system, as one of the important branches in the field of intelligent transportation, has also received more and more attention. Among them, video-based moving target recognition technology involves theoretical knowledge in various fields such as artificial intelligence, image processing, pattern recognition and computer vision. It is an important means to realize ""safe city"" and ""smart city"" and a key technology for intelligent monitoring. Therefore, the research on human motion target recognition algorithm in complex traffic environment has important theoretical and practical value. In the field of intelligent traffic monitoring, the moving target detection and recognition effect of video images will have certain influence on the classification and behavior understanding of subsequent moving targets. In this paper, the commonly used moving target detection methods are studied first, and the convergence problem of the traditional Adaboost algorithm is improved. An Adaboost algorithm based on adaptive weight update is proposed, and then the support vector machine (SVM) is used. The algorithm identifies the detected moving target. Finally, through simulation experiments on the acquired video images, the results show that the proposed human motion target recognition algorithm based on adaptive weight update Adaboost and SVM has good feasibility and rationality. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.","This work was supported by the Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province under Grant (2017A070709012), the quality resource sharing course project \Computer Network"" (O±cial document by Department of Education of Guangdong province ([2015] No. 133)), the provincial-level characteristic specialty-\Network Engineering"" and the provincial teaching team — \Teaching team of basic core course of computer major"" (O±cial document by Department of Education of Guangdong Province ([2017]214)), 2018 Higher Education Teaching Reform Project of Guangdong province — \Reform and practice of the training mode of network engineering talents based on the cooperation of school-school and school-enterprise"" (O±cial document by Department of Education of Guangdong Province ([2018] No. 180)) and the university-level high-quality resource-sharing course project — \Network Security Technology"", \Wireless Sensor Network and RFID Technology"" and National Natural Science Foundation of China Youth Science Foundation (No. 61601172).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072088851,Yes,China,Transportation,Urban Mobility,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Target Recognition Algorithm,Object Detection,Research human movement target recognition algorithm in complex traffic environment for intelligent transportation,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

Rapid urbanization inevitably brings serious ecological and environmental problems. In order to better monitor the urbanization process of mega-cities, this study, which focus on north of the Yangtze river of Wuhan metropolitan region, attempts aimed to analyze the urban landscape pattern characteristics and the trends of urbanization trends by using the north of the Yangtze River of Wuhan metropolitan region as the case study. In this study, we proposed a modified Spectral-Spatial Unified Network (SSUN-)-CRF method, which revised from a Spectral-Spatial Unified Networks classification (SSUN) method, based on deep-learning, to extract the urban land use classification on a fine scale and recover detailed structure with GF-5 hyperspectral data in 2018. Then, we assessed seven key landscape pattern indices to understand the landscape pattern features of seven regions in Wuhan, which are separated into main urban area and suburban area. Then, in this paper we built the urban expansion model, from class metrics to landscape metrics. Index). Wuhan shows the stable and diverse landscape ecological with balanced land use distribution. What's more, after using moving window to evaluate the state of Wuhan's urbanization, it is clear to see the tendency in line from the main urban area to the southeast and southwest of the suburban districts. The main urban area is more evenly distributed and urbanized than the suburban area. Evenness Index) and SHEI (Shannon's Diversity Index), SHDI (Shannon's Dimension), CONTAG (Contagion Fractal Area Index) indices illustrate that Jianghan District has the most evenly distributed commercial area, and has the center of business in Wuhan. While, the commercial area in the suburban district is less and concentrated. (3) On the landscape metrics level: We choose 4 indices to analysis the landscape in Wuhan including PAFRAC (Perimeter The resulst show that: (1) The SSUN-CRF classification algorithm can achieve as little loss of spectral information as possible while taking into account spatial information. Our method can effectively achieve edge refinement and overcome the misclassification of semantic segmentation. The Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa were higher than 0.9048 and 0.8807, respectively. (2) According to the landscape analysis, on the class metrics level: the PLAND (Percentage of Landscape) indices of different classes in different districts demonstrate that Wuhan has abundant water resource, the main urban area of Wuhan is more urbanized than that of suburban area. Comparing three kinds of residential areas, Residential Two is the principal part with high-rise buildings. It indicate that Wuhan has a higher per capita living standard. However, Hanyang District develops slower than other main urban areas with the problem of ""villages in the city"". Furthermore, the advantages of agriculture and water area in the suburban area are obvious, the ecological environment is good, but the urbanization degree is low. The the ecological virescence of suburban area needs to be improved. The PD (Patch Density) and AI (Aggregation The results of this research of serve as guide for the overall development plan, optimizing land use optimization, and sustainable development construction in Wuhan.

It is not an easy task due to spectral heterogeneity and structural diversity of the complex backgrounds. In this paper, an object-based multi-modal convolution neural networks (OMM-CNN) is proposed for building extraction using panchromatic and multispectral imagery. Specifically, a multi-modal deep CNN (the multispectral CNN and the panchromatic CNN) architecture is designed which can mine multiscale spectral-spatial contextual information. In order to fully explore the spatial-spectral information embedded in panchromatic and multispectral images, the complex convolution and complex self-adaption pooling layer are developed. Furthermore, to improve the building extraction accuracy and efficiency, a simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) algorithm is used to segment the panchromatic and multispectral remote sensing imagery simultaneous. Results demonstrated that the proposed method can extract different types of buildings, and the result is more accurate and effective than that of the recent building extraction methods. © 2019","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Plan of China (grant numbers 2017YFB0503604, 2016YFE0200400), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 41971405, 41901394, 41671442, 41571430, 41271442).; Funding text 2: This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Plan of China (grant numbers 2017YFB0503604 , 2016YFE0200400 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 41971405 , 41901394 , 41671442 , 41571430 , 41271442 ).

The country is increasingly confronted with severe conflicts that originate from trade-offs between actors involved in the agricultural sector. This work presents an integrated valuation of alternative land use scenarios in the Carcarañá River Lower Basin, offering a way to link the various value domains by involving a broad set of multidimensional indicators and stakeholder concerns. Twenty-one indicators that address all three pillars of sustainability, environmental, economic and social, are selected and quantified. Three scenarios are analyzed: the Actual scenario, dominated by industrial-scale agriculture that primarily yields soybeans, maize and wheat; a Conservation Agriculture scenario, promoting permanent soil cover by crop rotation and the implementation of untreated buffer zones around the cities; and a Short Sighted Exploitation scenario, contributing to short-term profits for agribusiness but increasing pressure on the natural resources. A decision support system is implemented in the Driver, Pressure, State, and Ecosystem Services indicator framework. The Conservation Agriculture scenario is identified as the best option by stakeholders grouped into Regulatory State, Civil Society and Consensus perspectives. A ranking change occurs when the valuation is carried out from the Private Sector point of view and the Actual scenario comes in first position. We dare to say that the methodology presented in this work is a socio-technical innovation that can contribute to the process needed to achieve broad consensus among the agribusiness actors in Argentina. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",This research was supported by the National Scientific and Technical Research Council of Argentina ( CONICET ).,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078654287,No,Argentina,Agriculture,Environmental Quality,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Scenario Modeling,Simulation,Present integrated valuation of alternative land use scenarios in agricultural ecosystem of a watershed in Pampas region,SDG 15: Life on Land,Empirical,,,,,

As a result, many scientists study the phenomenon, and some of them have focused on producing landslide susceptibility maps that can be used by land-use managers to reduce injury and damage. This paper contributes to this effort by comparing the power and effectiveness of five machine learning, benchmark algorithms—Logistic Model Tree, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes Tree, Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine—in creating a reliable shallow landslide susceptibility map for Bijar City in Kurdistan province, Iran. Twenty conditioning factors were applied to 111 shallow landslides and tested using the One-R attribute evaluation (ORAE) technique for modeling and validation processes. The performance of the models was assessed by statistical-based indexes including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operatic characteristic curve (AUC). Results indicate that all the five machine learning models performed well for shallow landslide susceptibility assessment, but the Logistic Model Tree model (AUC = 0.932) had the highest goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy, followed by the Logistic Regression (AUC = 0.932), Naïve Bayes Tree (AUC = 0.864), ANN (AUC = 0.860), and Support Vector Machine (AUC = 0.834) models. Therefore, we recommend the use of the Logistic Model Tree model in shallow landslide mapping programs in semi-arid regions to help decision makers, planners, land-use managers, and government agencies mitigate the hazard and risk. © 2020 by the authors.

In this study, we further develop the Street-Frontage-Net (SFN), a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can successfully evaluate the quality of street frontage as either being active (frontage containing windows and doors) or blank (frontage containing walls, fences and garages). Small-scale studies have indicated that the more active the frontage, the livelier and safer a street feels. However, collecting the city-level data necessary to evaluate street frontage quality is costly. The SFN model uses a deep CNN to classify the frontage of a street. This study expands on the previous research via five experiments. We find robust results in classifying frontage quality for an out-of-sample test set that achieves an accuracy of up to 92.0%. We also find active frontages in a neighbourhood has a significant link with increased house prices. Lastly, we find that active frontage is associated with more scenicness compared to blank frontage.

The close relationship between historical weather conditions and the corresponding passenger flow has been widely analyzed by researchers. However, few studies have explored the issue of how to use historical weather data to make passenger flow forecasting more accurate. To this end, an hourly metro passenger flow forecasting model using a deep long short-term memory neural network (LSTM_NN) was developed. The optimized traditional input variables, including the different temporal data and historical passenger flow data, were combined with weather variables for data modeling. A comprehensive analysis of the weather impacts on short-term metro passenger flow forecasting is discussed in this paper. The experimental results confirm that weather variables have a significant effect on passenger flow forecasting. It is interesting to find out that the previous variables of one-hour temperature and wind speed are the two most important weather variables to obtain more accurate forecasting results on rainy days at Taipei Main Station, which is a primary interchange station in Taipei. Compared to the four widely used algorithms, the deep LSTM_NN is an extremely powerful method, which has the capability of making more accurate forecasts when suitable weather variables are included. © 2020 by the authors.","This work was supported in part by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, R.O.C.

Unfortunately, to date, traditional techniques for estimating rainfall levels present numerous critical issues. The algorithm applies the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) directly to the audio signal, using 3 s sliding windows with an offset of only 100 milliseconds. Therefore, by using low cost and low power hardware, the proposed algorithm allows implementing critical high rainfall event alerting mechanisms with short response times and low estimation errors. More specifically, this paper proposes a new approach to rainfall estimation based on the classification of different acoustic timbres that rain produces at different intensities and on CNN. The results obtained on seven classes ranging from ""No rain"" to ""Cloudburst"" indicate an average accuracy of 75%, which rises to 93% if the misclassifications of the adjacent classes are not considered. Some application contexts concern smart cities for which the integration of an audio sensor inside the luminaire of a street lamp is foreseen, precision agriculture, as well as highway safety, by minimizing the risks of aquaplaning. © 2020 by the authors.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085064612,Yes,Italy,Environmental Monitoring,Environmental Quality,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),Classification,Develop an innovative acoustic rain gauge based on convolutional neural networks for accurate rainfall estimation,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities; SDG 13: Climate Action,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

However, the micro-territorial level, which encompasses a community perspective, has not been examined through a comprehensive forecasting method of sustainability categories with machine learning tools. This study aims to establish a method to forecast the sustainability levels of an urban ecosystem through supervised modeling. To this end, it was necessary to establish a set of indicators that characterize the dimensions of sustainable development, consistent with the Sustainable Development Goals. Using the data normalization technique to process the information and combining it in different dimensions made it possible to identify the sustainability level of the urban zone for each year from 2009 to 2017. The resulting information was the basis for the supervised classification. It was found that the sustainability level in the micro-territory has been improving from a low level in 2009, which increased to a medium level in the subsequent years. Forecasts of the sustainability levels of the zone were possible by using decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines, in which 70% of the data were used to train the machine learning tools, with the remaining 30% used for validation.

Using pervasive mobile devices and AI technology, it is now possible to develop smart edge-based service system for monitoring and detecting the cleanliness of streets at scale. This paper explores an important aspect of cities - how to automatically analyze street imagery to understand the level of street litter. A vehicle (i.e. trash truck) equipped with smart edge station and cameras is used to collect and process street images in real time.

Crop areas have been recognized efficiently and accurately via remote sensing (RS) and machine learning (ML), especially deep learning (DL), which are too rough for modern smallholder production. In this paper, a delimitation-grading method for actual crop production units (ACPUs) based on RS images was explored using a combination of a mask region-based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN), spatial analysis, comprehensive index evaluation, and cluster analysis. Da'an City, Jilin province, China, was chosen as the study region to satisfy the agro-production demands in modern smallholder areas. Firstly, the ACPUs were interpreted from perspectives such as production mode, spatial form, and actual productivity. Secondly, cultivated land plots (C-plots) were extracted by Mask R-CNN with high-resolution RS images, which were used to delineate contiguous cultivated land plots (CC-plots) on the basis of auxiliary data correction. Then, the refined delimitation-grading results of the ACPUs were obtained through comprehensive evaluation of spatial characteristics and real productivity clustering. For the conclusion, the effectiveness of the Mask R-CNN model in C-plot recognition (loss = 0.16, mean average precision (mAP) = 82.29%) and a reasonable distance threshold (20 m) for CC-plot delimiting were verified. The spatial features were evaluated with the scale-shape dimensions of nine specific indicators. Real productivities were clustered by the incorporation of two-step cluster and K-Means cluster. Furthermore, most of the ACPUs in the study area were of a reasonable scale and an appropriate shape, holding real productivities at a medium level or above. The proposed method in this paper can be adjusted according to the changes of the study area with flexibility to assist agro-supervision in many modern smallholder regions. © 2020, by the authors.",This research was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFF0206801-2).,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084270469,No,China,Agriculture,Environmental Quality,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Mask R-CNN,Segmentation,Extract and evaluate crop production units in modern smallholder regions using RS data and Mask R-CNN,SDG 2: Zero Hunger,Empirical,,,,,

For sure, one technology with a strong impact is the so-called Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT paradigm made it possible to break down the data barrier between the vertical domains on which the traditional information and communication technology (ICT) world was organized. Recently, the designers of home automation systems have begun looking to the IoT paradigm to ease the deployment of systems that are able to collect data from different plants. Such a situation has driven further evolution from the traditional automation system, where logic is defined by the programmer or by the user, to a cognitive system that is able to learn from the user’ habits regarding what should be the best configuration of plants. Several countries are funding renovations of public and private buildings for improving energy efficiency. Generally, such renovations are only focusing on the structure of the building and of its energy performance (e.g., the thermal envelope, window units, air-conditioning plants, and renewable generators) and largely ignoring the use of intelligent devices. On the contrary, scientific literature and practice have demonstrated that the wider use of IoT sensors, as well as distributed and remote intelligence, is fundamental to optimize energy consumption. This research work aimed to identify issues due the application of cognitive solutions during the renovation phase of buildings. In particular, the paper presents a cognitive architecture to support the operation and management phases of buildings, thanks to the massive digitalization of the entire supply chain of the construction sector from the single building element to the entire construction process. Such an architecture is capable of combining data from the IoT sensors and actuators of smart objects installed during the renovation phase, as well as legacy building automation systems. As an indication of the capability of the proposed solution, an intelligent window device was developed and validated. Within the Energy, Life Styled, and Seismic Innovation for Regenerated Buildings (ELISIR) project, window units are equipped with sensors to monitor indoor and outdoor condition behaviours of users. In addition, windows are able to react to changes in the environment by means of actuators that enable motorized opening and shading. Thanks to the cognitive layer designed in the project, the window is able to automatically define the best rules for opening and shading by using the local controller to satisfy user’s habits and energy effciency targets. The cognitive layer defines the appropriate rules for opening and shading using the decision tree algorithm applied to the data generated by the sensors in order to infer users’ preferences. For this research, two prototypes of the window units were installed in two offces of Politecnico di Milano, Italy. The accuracy of this algorithm to classify the users’ behaviour and preferences was found to be around 90%, considering an observation interval of two months. © 2020 by the authors.

Several countries are funding renovation plans to improve the energy efficiency of existing buildings. Generally, these renovations focus on the replacement of existing window units with more efficient ones, the addition of external/internal thermal insulation coatings, and the improvement of existing electric and hydraulic plants. The ELISIR project, funded by Regione Lombardia, Italy, aims to digitalize the entire supply chain of the construction sector, from the producer of building elements, through the construction company, and to the final maintenance company. The thread that links each component of the supply chain is data from its generation to its interpretation. The idea behind the project is to integrate the “intelligence” into building elements that are frequently used during renovation: window units, hydraulic connections, electric components, and thermal and seismic coatings. Once installed, these elements start to monitor the renovated building through integrated sensors, and they can optimize the energy efficiency by actuating command. In this way, it is possible to reduce the costs of the installation of separated sensors and actuators. The data generated by the integrated sensors are processed by a cognitive layer, which automatically infers information about the state of the building and the users’ habits and needs in order to optimize the behaviour of the entire building in terms of energy efficiency and comfort. In particular, this paper focuses on the integration of an instrumented window unit with the cognitive layer for the identification—through a machine learning algorithm—of users’ behaviour.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083990790,Yes,Italy,Smart Buildings,Smart Infrastructure,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,"IoT, Cognitive Computing",Optimization,Develop cognitive-driven building renovation for improving energy efficiency using IoT paradigm,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy; SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

The substantial increment of the LST creates urban heat island (UHI) effects in cities. This study first identified the pattern of the LULC changes, and later, investigated their impacts on LST in Rajshahi City Corporation (RCC) areas for the years of 1999, 2009 and 2019 using Landsat TM/OLI satellite images. This study explored the impact of LULC change on LST through LST distribution in different land use categories, cross-section profile of LULC wise LST variability, and a correlation between LULC indexes (NDVI, NDBI, NDBaI & NDWI) and LST. The Multi-Layer Perceptron-Markov Chain (MLP-MC) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods were utilized to simulate the LULC and LST maps, respectively, for the years of 2029 and 2039. The accuracy of LULC and LST simulation models are more than 85% and 90%, respectively, based on the validation results. Simulation results show if the current trend of urban growth continues, 70% and 88% of RCC area will experience temperature more than 38 °C in 2029 and 2039, respectively. Such impacts need to be considered and evaluated immediately for ensuring sustainable urbanization and natural resource management in the RCC area.

However, the IoT devices and data are susceptible to various attacks, including cyberattacks, which emphasizes the need for pervasive security measure like trust evaluation on the fly. There exist several IoT numerical data trustworthiness measures which are based on the quality of information (QoI) and correlations. The QoI measurement techniques excessively exploit heuristics, while the correlation-based approaches predict temporal correlation using an average or moving average, which limits their efficacy. To improve accuracy and reliability, we propose a model for assessing trust of IoT sensor numerical data by representing the temporal correlation using temporal relationship. We represent the temporal relationship between data within a time window in two ways: first, using the discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients of daily data; and second, to obtain the impact of shuttle variation, we further divide the daily data into some time windows and calculate the average of each DCT coefficient over all time windows. These two feature sets are then used to develop two independent deep neural network models. The model outcomes are fused by the Dempster-Shepard theory to calculate trust scores. The strength of our model is evaluated using both trustworthy and untrustworthy data - the former are collected from sensors under controlled supervision in a smart city project in Melbourne, Australia and the latter are generated either by simulating breached sensors or perturbing real data. Our proposed approach outperforms a contemporary correlation-based approach in terms of trust score accuracy and consistency. © 2014 IEEE.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083717158,Yes,Australia,IoT and Edge Computing,Smart Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Trust Evaluation Model,Security/Anomaly Detection,Develop IoT sensor numerical data trust model using temporal correlation for pervasive security in smart city applications,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

AI with its deep learning functions and capabilities can be employed as a tool which empowers machines to solve problems that could reform urban landscapes as we have known them for decades now and help with establishing a new era; the era of the ""smart city"". One of the key areas that AI can redefine is transport. Mobility provision and its impact on urban development can be significantly improved by the employment of intelligent transport systems in general and automated transport in particular. This new breed of AI-based mobility, despite its machine-orientation, has to be a user-centred technology that ""understands"" and ""satisfies"" the human user, the markets and the society as a whole. Trust should be built, and risks should be eliminated, for this transition to take off. This paper provides a novel conceptual contribution that thoroughly discusses the scarcely studied nexus of AI, transportation and the smart city and how this will affect urban futures. It specifically covers key smart mobility initiatives referring to Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), autonomous Personal and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (PAVs and UAVs) and Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS), but also interventions that may work as enabling technologies for transport, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Physical Internet (PI) or reflect broader transformations like Industry 4.0.

The method consists of day-ahead optimal power flow (DA-OPF) for day-ahead SCM managing and its subsequent evaluation, considering forecast uncertainties. The DA-OPF is based on a data forecast system that uses a deep learning (DL) long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The OPF problem is formulated as a mathematical mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model. Following this, the developed DA-OPF strategy was evaluated under possible operations, using a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The MCS allowed us to obtain potential deviations of forecasted data during possible day-ahead operations and to evaluate the impact of the data forecast errors on the SCM, and that of unit limitation and the emergence of critical situations. Simulation results on a real existing rural conventional community endowed with a centralized community renewable generation (CCRG) and CESS, confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed operation method. The economic analysis showed significant benefits and an electricity price reduction for the considered community if compared to a conventional distribution system, as well as the easy applicability of the proposed method due to the CESS and the developed operating systems. © 2020 by the authors.

Several diseases such as asthma and cardiovascular conditions are becoming more diffuse, due to a rise in pollution exposure and a more sedentary lifestyle. Healthcare providers deal with increasing new challenges, and thanks to fast-developing big data technologies, they can be faced with systems that provide direct support to citizens. In this context, within the EU-funded Participatory Urban Living for Sustainable Environments (PULSE) project, we are implementing a data analytic platform designed to provide public health decision makers with advanced approaches, to jointly analyze maps and geospatial information with healthcare and air pollution data. In this paper we describe a component of such platforms, which couples deep learning analysis of urban geospatial images with healthcare indexes collected by the 500 Cities project. By applying a pre-learned deep Neural Network architecture, satellite images of New York City are analyzed and latent feature variables are extracted. These features are used to derive clusters, which are correlated with healthcare indicators by means of a multivariate classification model. Thanks to this pipeline, it is possible to show that, in New York City, health care indexes are significantly correlated to the urban landscape. This pipeline can serve as a basis to ease urban planning, since the same interventions can be organized on similar areas, even if geographically distant. © 2020 by the authors.

As a typical task of time series mining, Time Series Classification (TSC) has attracted lots of attention from both researchers and domain experts due to its broad applications ranging from human activity recognition to smart city governance. Specifically, there is an increasing requirement for performing classification tasks on diverse types of time series data in a timely manner without costly hand-crafting feature engineering. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a framework named Edge4TSC that allows time series to be processed in the edge environment, so that the classification results can be instantly returned to the end-users. Meanwhile, to get rid of the costly hand-crafting feature engineering process, deep learning techniques are applied for automatic feature extraction, which shows competitive or even superior performance compared to state-of-the-art TSC solutions. However, because time series presents complex patterns, even deep learning models are not capable of achieving satisfactory classification accuracy, which motivated us to explore new time series representation methods to help classifiers further improve the classification accuracy. In the proposed framework Edge4TSC,by building the binary distribution tree, a new time series representation method was designed for addressing the classification accuracy concern in TSC tasks. By conducting comprehensive experiments on six challenging time series datasets in the edge environment, the potential of the proposed framework for its generalization ability and classification accuracy improvement is firmly validated with a number of helpful insights. © 2020 by the authors.

Two alternative sources of big visual data, namely web images and Google Street View imagery, were studied in a semi-supervised setting to minimize the costs associated with data collection and expert annotation. The features of interest include infrastructure defects and degradation such as different types of cracks, potholes, patches, faded markings, fallen signs, and sidewalk cracks and trip hazards. In the proposed multi-transform self-training approach, an ensemble of predictions on a set of geometric transformations of each unlabeled street view image was used to automatically pseudo-label images and retrain the model. This concept eliminates the need for human supervision, thus improving the scalability of the approach. Results show that the proposed transforms can significantly improve the performance of the model (more than 20% accuracy improvement) and reduce the domain gap between Google Street View and web images. A sensitivity analysis was also presented to study the factors influencing the method, and an error analysis was performed to explain a number of misclassification cases in the results. The proposed approach can be used to leverage the wealth of information embedded in the massive sources of imagery that are available to researchers, and the resulting models can be used to automatically process image streams from volunteer citizens, social media, as well as private and public vehicle cameras such as city buses and transportation agency vehicles to automate the urban condition monitoring task. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","The authors would like to acknowledge Advanced Research Computing Services (ARCS) at the University of Virginia for providing computational resources and technical support that have contributed to the results reported within this paper.

As the roadmap of urban traffic, the urban expressway has a relatively high and stable driving speed, and also bears a large amount of urban traffic. However, in recent years, with the expansion of the city scale, the congestion of urban expressways has become increasingly severe. In various areas of the merged area, due to various factors such as mismatched traffic capacity and reduced driving speed, it is easy to cause deterioration of road conditions in a short period of time and cause more secondary accidents. In order to reduce the incidence of expressway traffic accidents and to avoid as much as possible the casualties and property losses caused by accidents, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) supported by information technology, data communication transmission technology, control technology and traffic engineering were introduced. With the rise of artificial intelligence and the continuous development of ITS, the video acquisition methods of real-time traffic flow data and the image recognition ability of video sequences continue to improve, providing theoretical basis and technical support for the research of urban expressway parallel pattern recognition. Aiming at the shortcomings of traditional pattern recognition methods, such as weak anti-interference to complex traffic environment and low correct recognition rate, this paper studies the pattern recognition method based on image processing, and selects the fuzzy C-means clustering in the currently used clustering methods (FCM) algorithm Because the FCM algorithm cannot obtain the global optimal solution and need to determine the number of cluster categories in advance, this paper uses ReliefF algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to compare the feature weight and number of clusters of traditional FCM algorithm. Make improvements. Through the experimental analysis of the acquired video images, the results show that the improved FCM algorithm based on the proposed method has better real-time and accuracy in the application of urban expressway parallel pattern recognition. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Funding text 1: Hongfei Jia was born in Jimuo, Shandong, P.R.

Previous cellular automata (CA)-based methods usually treated the LUC dynamics as Markov processes and proposed a series of CA-Markov models, which however, were intrinsically unable to capture the long-term temporal dependency. Meanwhile, such models used only numerical proportion of neighboring land use (LU) types to represent neighborhood effects of LUC, which inevitably neglected the complicated spatial heterogeneity and thus caused inaccurate simulation results. To address these problems, this paper presents a novel CA model integrated with deep learning (DL) techniques to model spatio-temporal LUC dynamics. Our DL-CA model firstly uses a convolutional neural network to capture latent spatial features for complete representation of neighborhood effects. A recurrent neural network then extracts historical information of LUC from time-series land use maps. A random forest is appended as binary change predictor to avoid the imbalanced sample problem during model training. Land use data collected from 2000 to 2014 of the Dongguan City, China were used to verify our proposed DL-CA model. The input data from 2000 to 2009 were used for model training, the 2010 data for model validation, and the data collected from 2011 to 2014 were used for model evaluation. In addition, four traditional CA models of multilayer perceptron (MLP)-CA, support vector machine (SVM)-CA, logistic regression (LR)-CA and random forest (RF)-CA were also developed for accuracy comparisons. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DL-CA model accurately captures long-term spatio-temporal dependency for more accurate LUC prediction results. The DL-CA model raised prediction accuracy by 9.3%–11.67% in 2011–2014 in contrast to traditional CA models. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",This work is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No.: 2017YFB0503802 ).,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079211131,Yes,China,Land Use,Urban Planning,Urban Development & Land Use,"Deep Learning, Cellular Automata",Simulation,Develop a novel cellular automata model integrated with deep learning for dynamic spatio-temporal land use change simulation,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Past,Longitudinal,Medium

Since this neglects factors of internal spatial composition and heterogeneity of EO data, we suggest a novel scheme deriving continuous indicators of vegetation heterogeneity from high-resolution EO data. The deployed concepts encompass vegetation fractions for determining vegetation density and spectral traits for the quantification of vegetation heterogeneity. Both indicators are derived from RapidEye data, thus featuring a continuous spatial resolution of 6.5 m. Using these indicators as predictors, we model breeding bird habitats using a random forest (RF) classifier for the city of Leipzig, Germany using a single EO image. SDMs are trained for the breeding sites of 44 urban bird species, featuring medium to very high accuracies (59–90%). Analysing similarities between the models regarding variable importance of single predictors allows species groups to be determined based on their preferences and dependencies regarding the amount of vegetation and its spatial and structural heterogeneity. When combining the SDMs, models of urban bird species richness can be derived. The combination of high-resolution EO data paired with the RF machine learning technique creates very detailed insights into the ecology of the urban avifauna, opening up opportunities of optimising greenspace management schemes or urban development in densifying cities concerning overall bird species richness or single species under threat of local extinction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Funding text 1: This research was carried out as part of the project ENABLE, funded through the 2015–2016 BiodivERsA COFUND call for research proposals, with the national funders The Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences, and Spatial Planning, Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, German Aeronautics and Space Research Centre, National Science Centre (Poland), The Research Council of Norway and the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness.

The time required for a given trajectory in a transportation system can be accurately estimated using the trajectory data of the taxis in a city. This is a very challenging task. Although historical data have been used in existing research, excessive use of trajectory information in historical data or inaccurate neighbor trajectory information does not allow for a better prediction accuracy of the query trajectory. In this article, we propose a deep learning method based on neighbors for travel time estimation (TTE), called the Nei-TTE method. We divide the entire trajectory into multiple disjoint segments and use the historical trajectory data approximated at the time level. Our model captures the characteristics of each segment and utilizes the trajectory characteristics of adjacent segments as the road network topology and speed interact. We use velocity features to effectively represent adjacent segment structures. The experiments on the Porto dataset show that the experimental results of our model are significantly better than those of the existing models. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Funding text 1: This article was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Plan under Grant 2018YFB0803504 and Grant 2018YEB1004003, in part by the Guangdong Province Key Research and Development Plan under Grant 2019B010137004, and in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61871140, Grant 61872100, Grant 61572153, and Grant U1636215.

We also explore the powerful combination of Big Data and Computational Intelligence (CI) and identify a number of areas, where novel applications in real world smart city problems can be developed by utilizing these powerful tools and techniques. We present a case study for intelligent transportation in the context of a smart city, and a novel data modelling methodology based on a biologically inspired universal generative modelling approach called Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal State Machine (HSTSM). We further discuss various implications of policy, protection, valuation and commercialization related to Big Data, its applications and deployment. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Rahat Iqbal is Chief Executive Officer of Interactive Coventry Ltd. and a Reader/Associate Professor in the Faculty of Engineering, Environment and Computing at Coventry University.

A century later, in the smart era, the network to deliver services goes far beyond a single entity like electricity. Supplemented by a wellestablished Internet infrastructure that can run an endless number of applications, abundant processing and storage capabilities of clouds, resilient edge computing, and sophisticated data analysis like machine learning and deep learning, an already-booming Internet of Things movement makes this new era far more exciting. In this article, we present a multi-faceted survey of machine intelligence in modern implementations. We partition smart city infrastructure into application, sensing, communication, security, and data planes and put an emphasis on the data plane as the mainstay of computing and data storage. We investigate (i) a centralized and distributed implementation of data plane's physical infrastructure and (ii) a complementary application of data analytics, machine learning, deep learning, and data visualization to implement robust machine intelligence in a smart city software core.

We split existing solutions into two main classes: occupant-centric versus energy/devices-centric. The first class groups solutions that use ML for aspects related to the occupants, including (1) occupancy estimation and identification, (2) activity recognition, and (3) estimating preferences and behavior. The second class groups solutions that use ML to estimate aspects related either to energy or devices. They are divided into three categories: (1) energy profiling and demand estimation, (2) appliances profiling and fault detection, and (3) inference on sensors. Solutions in each category are presented, discussed, and compared; open perspectives and research trends are discussed as well. Compared to related state-of-the-art survey papers, the contribution herein is to provide a comprehensive and holistic review from the ML perspectives rather than architectural and technical aspects of existing building management systems. This is by considering all types of ML tools, buildings, and several categories of applications, and by structuring the taxonomy accordingly.

Currently, the studies on urban growth boundary delineation mostly use model method, such as Cellular Automata (CA) model, a relatively mature model, to simulate future urban patterns. However, these studies mostly focuses on the delineation of urban growth boundary. There is little effort on quantitative delineation of the inertia boundary of urban growth. The delineation of inertial boundaries can not only reserve a certain space for urban development, but also improve implementation efficiency in urban planning. Based on this, we proposed a method based on the kinetic energy theorem of the mechanics. The FLUS model and the Morphological Erosion and Dilation method (MED) were used to delineate the urban growth boundary. Slope and land use type were used as the frictional force to delimit the inertial boundary. The FLUS model inherits the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and the Cellular Automaton(CA) model for simulating and predicting the future urban landscape. The MED was used for the clustering of urban neighborhoods to merge into a single area, while eliminating small but isolated urban plaque. In our paper, we selected Fuzhou, a coastal developed city with obvious changes in recent years, as the study area. We simulated the land use patterns from 2000 to 2015 to verify the accuracy of the model. The overall accuracy of land use simulation in 2015 was 0.9389 and the Kappa coefficient was 0.9165. We further predicted the land use pattern in 2027, and delineated the urban growth boundary and inertia boundary in 2027. Results show that the FLUS model and MED can effectively simulate land use and better fit the growth boundary of urban land use. Using the method of kinetic energy theorem for reference, the inertia boundary of a city can be well delineated according to the expansion resistance in different directions and the expansion intensity in different directions, which provides practical operability and reference values for future study. © 2020, Science Press.

The strong dependency on the synoptic weather conditions, rather than on city-specific, constant features, hinders the identification of recurrent patterns, leading conventional predicting algorithms to fail. In this paper, an advanced artificial intelligence technique based on long short-term memory (LSTM) model is applied to gain insight and predict the highly fluctuating heat island intensity (UHII) in the city of Sydney, Australia, governed by the dualistic system of cool sea breeze from the ocean and hot western winds from the vast desert biome inlands. Hourly measurements of temperature, collected for a period of 18 years (1999–2017) from 8 different sites in a 50 km radius from the coastline, were used to train (80%) and test (20%) the model. Other inputs included date, time, and previously computed UHII, feedbacked to the model with an optimized time step of six hours. A second set of models integrated wind speed at the reference station to account for the sea breeze effect. The R2 ranged between 0.770 and 0.932 for the training dataset and between 0.841 and 0.924 for the testing dataset, with the best performance attained right in correspondence of the city hot spots. Unexpectedly, very little benefit (0.06–0.43%) was achieved by including the sea breeze among the input variables. Overall, this study is insightful of a rather rare climatological case at the watershed between maritime and desertic typicality. We proved that accurate UHII predictions can be achieved by learning from long-term air temperature records, provided that an appropriate predicting architecture is utilized. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076845963,Yes,South Korea,Urban Climate,Environmental Quality,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Prediction Modeling,Prediction/Forecasting,Predict magnitude and characteristics of urban heat island in coastal cities in proximity of desert landforms for Sydney,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities; SDG 13: Climate Action,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

The digital content in social media can be used for many smart city applications (SCAs)1 . Classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are challenging to parallelize and insufficient to capture long term contextual semantic features for sentiment analysis. In this perspective, this paper initially proposes a domain-specific distributed word representation (DS-DWR)2 with a considerably small corpus size induced from textual resources in social media. In DS-DWR, different Distributed Word Representations are concatenated to builds rich representations over the input sequence, which is worthwhile for infrequent and unseen terms. Second, a dilated convolutional neural network (D-CNN)3 , which is composed of three parallel dilated convolutional neural network (PD-CNN)4 layers and a global average pooling (GAP)5 layer. Our considered parallel dilated convolution reduces dimension and incorporates an extension in the size of receptive fields without the loss of local information. Further, the long-term contextual semantic information is achieved by the use of different dilation rates. Experiments demonstrate that our architecture accomplishes comparable results with multiple hyperparameters tuning for better parallelism which leads to the minimized computational cost. © 2020",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85080046947,Yes,China,Social Media Analysis,Urban Services,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Parallel Dilated Convolutional Neural Network,Classification,Develop social media sentiment analysis through parallel dilated convolutional neural network for smart city applications,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

Due to the difference among different vehicle models recognition datasets, the accuracy of network model training in one scene will be greatly reduced in another one. However, if you don't have a lot of vehicle model datasets for the current scene, you cannot properly train a model. To address this problem, we study the problem of cold start of vehicle model recognition under cross-scenario. Under the condition of small amount of datasets, combined with the method of transfer learning, load the DAN (Deep Adaptation Networks) and JAN (Joint Adaptation Networks) domain adaptation modules into the convolutional neural network AlexNet and ResNet, and get four models: AlexNet-JAN, AlexNet-DAN, ResNet-JAN, and ResNet-DAN which can achieve a higher accuracy at the beginning.

Timely detection of vacant houses has become an inevitable task to aid the “Smart City” initiative. Two pressing problems exist for vacant houses, however: (1) No publicly accessible information is available at the individual house level and (2) the decennial census survey does not catch up with the rapidly changing status of vacant houses. To this end, remote sensing provides a low-cost avenue for detecting vacant houses. Traditionally, remote sensing was accredited for its success in deriving biophysical parameters of human settlements, such as the presence and physical size of buildings. It is still a challenge, though, to infer the functions of buildings, such as land-use types and occupancy status. In this study, we aim to detect individual vacant houses with very-high-resolution remote sensing images through a smart machine learning method. Our proposed method entails three steps: ground-truth data collection, classification, and feature selection. As a result, a new building change detection method was developed to collect ground-truth vacant house data from multitemporal images. Important features for classification of houses were identified. Subsequently, we carried out a classification of vacant houses and yielded promising results. Furthermore, the results indicate that both the area of the vacant house parcels and the healthy conditions of the surrounding vegetation contribute most to the detection accuracy. Our work shows the potential of using remote sensing to detect individual vacant houses at a large spatial extent.

However, as a high-density city, Macau’s limited urban space must cope with the growing population and the arrival of an aging society. In the existing studies, less attention has been paid to Macau, especially the relationship between Macanese elderly and urban space. This study uses Baidu Street View (BSV) on the Macau Peninsula and conducts field surveys to obtain street view data to evaluate the openness, greenness, interface coverage, and road area ratio of street space and its association with the physical and mental health of the elderly and social health. The results show that the data truly reflect the overall street space conditions on the Macau Peninsula. The street openness, greenery rate, and interface enclosure are all related to the elderly in various evaluations in areas with a higher population dependency index and aging index. Human space perception is related to health gain, and road area ratio is weaker than other indicators.

At the same time, they require high computational power. Thus, widely used low-power IoT devices, which gather a substantial amount of data, cannot directly apply the corresponding machine learning algorithms to process it due to the lack of local computational resources. A method for fast detection and classification of moving objects for low-power single-board computers is shown in this paper. The developed algorithm uses geometric parameters of an object as well as scene-related parameters as features for classification. The extraction and classification of these features is a relatively simple process which can be executed by low-power IoT devices. The algorithm aims to recognize the most common objects in the street environment, e.g., pedestrians, cyclists, and cars. The algorithm can be applied in the dark environment by processing images from a near-infrared camera. The method has been tested on both synthetic virtual scenes and real-world data.

This 10V data growth poses two primary challenges, namely storing and processing. Concerning the latter, new frameworks have been developed including distributed platforms such as the Hadoop ecosystem. Classification is a major machine learning task typically executed on distributed platforms and as a consequence many algorithmic techniques have been developed tailored for these platforms. This article extensively relies in two ways on classifiers implemented in MLlib, the main machine learning library for the Hadoop ecosystem. First, a vast number of classifiers is applied to two datasets, namely Higgs and PAMAP. Second, a two-step classification is ab ovo performed to the same datasets. Specifically, the singular value decomposition of the data matrix determines first a set of transformed attributes which in turn drive the classifiers of MLlib. The twofold purpose of the proposed architecture is to reduce complexity while maintaining a similar if not better level of the metrics of accuracy, recall, and F1. The intuition behind this approach stems from the engineering principle of breaking down complex problems to simpler and more manageable tasks. The experiments based on the same Spark cluster indicate that the proposed architecture outperforms the individual classifiers with respect to both complexity and the abovementioned metrics. © 2020 by the authors.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083484270,Yes,Greece,Big Data Analytics,Smart Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"SVD, Machine Learning Classification",Classification,Develop two-step classification with SVD preprocessing of distributed massive datasets in Apache Spark for smart city sensors,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

In order to optimize the design and management of green spaces with regard to the provisioning of these ecosystem services, there is a clear need for uniform and spatially explicit datasets on the existing urban green infrastructure. Current mapping approaches, however, largely focus on large land use units (e.g., park, garden), or broad land cover classes (e.g., tree, grass), not providing sufficient thematic detail to model urban ecosystem service supply. We therefore proposed a functional urban green typology and explored the potential of both passive (2 m-hyperspectral and 0.5 m-multispectral optical imagery) and active (airborne LiDAR) remote sensing technology for mapping the proposed types using object-based image analysis and machine learning. Airborne LiDAR data was found to be the most valuable dataset overall, while fusion with hyperspectral data was essential for mapping the most detailed classes. High spectral similarities, along with adjacency and shadow effects still caused severe confusion, resulting in class-wise accuracies <50% for some detailed functional types. Further research should focus on the use of multi-temporal image analysis to fully unlock the potential of remote sensing data for detailed urban green mapping. © 2020 by the authors.","Funding text 1: The research presented in this paper is funded by the Belgian Science Policy Office in the framework of the STEREOIII program (UrbanEARS project (SR/00/307) and BelAir project (SR/01/354) for acquisition of hyperspectral data of Brussels).

An accurate assessment of its spatial and temporal distribution is mandatory to conduct epidemiological studies able to estimate long-term (e.g., annual) and short-term (e.g., daily) health effects. While spatiotemporal models for particulate matter (PM) have been developed in several countries, estimates of daily nitrogen dioxide (NO<inf>2</inf>) and ozone (O<inf>3</inf>) concentrations at high spatial resolution are lacking, and no such models have been developed in Sweden. We collected data on daily air pollutant concentrations from routine monitoring networks over the period 2005-2016 and matched them with satellite data, dispersion models, meteorological parameters, and land-use variables. We developed a machine-learning approach, the random forest (RF), to estimate daily concentrations of PM<inf>10</inf> (PM<10 microns), PM<inf>2.5</inf> (PM<2.5 microns), PM<inf>2.5-10</inf> (PM between 2.5 and 10 microns), NO<inf>2</inf>, and O<inf>3</inf> for each squared kilometer of Sweden over the period 2005-2016. Our models were able to describe between 64% (PM<inf>10</inf>) and 78% (O<inf>3</inf>) of air pollutant variability in held-out observations, and between 37% (NO<inf>2</inf>) and 61% (O<inf>3</inf>) in held-out monitors, with no major differences across years and seasons and better performance in larger cities such as Stockholm. These estimates will allow to investigate air pollution effects across the whole of Sweden, including suburban and rural areas, previously neglected by epidemiological investigations. © 2020 by the authors.

However, the existing methods developed in the literature for identifying urban functional regions have mainly been focused on single remote sensing image data or social sensing data. The multi-dimensional information which was attained from various data source and could reflect the attribute or function about the urban functional regions that could be lost in some extent. To sense urban functional regions comprehensively and accurately, we developed a multi-mode framework through the integration of spatial geographic characteristics of remote sensing images and the functional distribution characteristics of social sensing data of Point-of-Interest (POI). In this proposed framework, a deep multi-scale neural network was developed first for the functional recognition of remote sensing images in urban areas, which explored the geographic feature information implicated in remote sensing. Second, the POI function distribution was analyzed in different functional areas of the city, then the potential relationship between POI data categories and urban region functions was explored based on the distance metric. A new RPF module is further deployed to fuse the two characteristics in different dimensions and improve the identification performance of urban region functions. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method can efficiently achieve the accuracy of 82.14% in the recognition of functional regions. It showed the great usability of the proposed framework in the identification of urban functional regions and the potential to be applied in a wide range of areas. © 2020 by the authors.

Real-time monitoring of gully and drainage blockage is an important part of flood monitoring applications. Building viable IoT sensors for detecting blockage is a complex task due to the limitations of deploying such sensors in situ. Image classification with deep learning is a potential alternative solution. However, there are no image datasets of gullies and drainages. We were faced with such challenges as part of developing a flood monitoring application in a European Union-funded project. To address these issues, we propose a novel image classification approach based on deep learning with an IoT-enabled camera to monitor gullies and drainages. This approach utilises deep learning to develop an effective image classification model to classify blockage images into different class labels based on the severity. In order to handle the complexity of video-based images, and subsequent poor classification accuracy of the model, we have carried out experiments with the removal of image edges by applying image cropping. The process of cropping in our proposed experimentation is aimed to concentrate only on the regions of interest within images, hence leaving out some proportion of image edges. An image dataset from crowd-sourced publicly accessible images has been curated to train and test the proposed model. For validation, model accuracies were compared considering model with and without image cropping. The cropping-based image classification showed improvement in the classification accuracy. This paper outlines the lessons from our experimentation that have a wider impact on many similar use cases involving IoT-based cameras as part of smart city event monitoring platforms. © 2020, The Author(s).",Funding text 1: The research presented in this paper is funded by the European Regional Development Fund Interreg project Smart Cities and Open Data REuse (SCORE).; Funding text 2: The research presented in this paper is funded by the European Regional Development Fund Interreg project Smart Cities and Open Data REuse (SCORE).,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85080023868,Yes,United Kingdom,Disaster Management,Urban Safety,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Deep Learning,Object Detection,Apply deep learning with image cropping for real-time gully and drainage blockage monitoring in flood applications,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities; SDG 13: Climate Action,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

Machine and deep learning networks, therefore, are required to be in a form that is safe and deterministic in their development and also in their deployment. The viability of non-random weight initialisation schemes in neural networks make the network more deterministic in learning sessions which is a desirable property in safety critical systems where deep learning is applied to smart city applications and where public liability is a concern. The paper uses a variety of schemes over number ranges and gradients and achieved a 98.09% accuracy figure, + 0.126% higher than the original random number scheme at 97.964%. The paper highlights that in this case, it is the number range and not the gradient that is affecting the achieved accuracy most dominantly, although there can be a coupling of number range with activation functions used. Unexpectedly in this paper, an effect of numerical instability was discovered from run to run when run on a multi-core CPU. The paper also has shown the enforcement of consistent deterministic results on an multi-core CPU by defining atomic critical code regions, and that aids repeatable information assurance in model fitting (or learning sessions). That enforcement of consistent repeatable determinism has also a benefit to accuracy even for the random schemes, and a highest score of 98.29%, + 0.326% higher than the baseline was achieved. However, also the non-random initialisation scheme causes weight arrangements after learning to be more structured which has benefits for validation in safety critical applications. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078844859,Yes,United Kingdom,Smart City Governance,Smart Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Deep Learning,Methodology Development,Develop repeatable determinism using non-random weight initialisations for consistent deep learning in smart city applications,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure",Methodological,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

Autonomous driving will play an import role in the future smart cities, reduce the time and economic cost of the whole society, and be helpful for the sustainability of the city and society. A significant task for autonomous driving is to detect surrounding objects accurately in real-time, including car, pedestrian, cyclist, etc. In this paper, we propose one end-to-end three dimensional (3D) object detection method based on voxelization, sparse convolution, and feature fusion. The proposed method exploits only point cloud as input, and it has two key components—small voxels and efficient feature fusion. Instead of utilizing extra networks to transform voxels, we directly average the points within each voxel as their feature representation. To enrich features for prediction, we have designed a two-step feature fusion method called fusion of fusion network that can combine information of multiple scales and 3D space. We have submitted to the official test server of the 3D detection benchmark—KITTI, and achieved state-of-the-art performance especially in the Cyclist class.

In urban climate, sky detection is an important first step in gathering information about urban morphology and sky view factors. However, obtaining accurate results remains challenging and becomes even more complex using imagery captured under a variety of lighting and weather conditions. To address this problem, we present a new sky pixel detection system demonstrated to produce accurate results using a wide range of outdoor imagery types. Images are processed using a selection of mean-shift segmentation, K-means clustering, and Sobel filters to mark sky pixels in the scene. The algorithm for a specific image is chosen by a convolutional neural network, trained with 25,000 images from the Skyfinder data set, reaching 82% accuracy for the top three classes. This selection step allows the sky marking to follow an adaptive process and to use different techniques and parameters to best suit a particular image. An evaluation of fourteen different techniques and parameter sets shows that no single technique can perform with high accuracy across varied Skyfinder and Google Street View data sets. However, by using our adaptive process, large increases in accuracy are observed. The resulting system is shown to perform better than other published techniques. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","The support of the Commonwealth of Australia through the Cooperative Research Centre program is acknowledged.

Selected aspects of the platform, which covers the Glasgow, UK, city-region, are available to other researchers, and allows knowledge discovery on critical urban living themes, for example in transportation, lifelong learning, sustainable behavior, social cohesion, ways of being in a digital age, and other topics. It further allows research into the technological and methodological aspects of emerging forms of urban data. Key highlights of the platform include a multi-topic household and person-level survey; travel and activity diaries; a privacy and personal device sensitivity survey; a rich set of GPS trajectory data; accelerometer, light intensity and other personal environment sensor data from wearable devices; an image data collection at approximately 5-second resolution of participants’ daily lives; multiple forms of text-based and multimedia Internet data; high resolution satellite and LiDAR data; and data from transportation, weather and air quality sensors. We demonstrate the power of the platform in understanding personal behavior and urban patterns by means of three examples: an examination of the links between mobility and literacy/learning using the household survey, a social media analysis of urban activity patterns, and finally, the degree of physical isolation levels using deep learning algorithms on image data. The analysis highlights the importance of purposefully designed multi-construct and multi-instrument data collection approaches that are driven by theoretical frameworks underpinning complex urban challenges, and the need to link to policy frameworks (e.g., Smart Cities, Future Cities, UNESCO Learning Cities agendas) that have the potential to translate data to impactful decision-making. © 2019 The Authors","This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council , United Kingdom grant number ES/L011921/1 .",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075629092,Yes,United Kingdom,Urban Data Analytics,Urban Governance,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"Data Integration, Remote Sensing",Data Collection/Integration,Describe the Integrated Multimedia City Data platform for understanding urban living and mobility through composite survey and sensing,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Methodological,Mixed,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

However, how to smartly schedule the packet transmission in CIoT systems is still a key challenge, that is, how to design a smart agent to realize the intelligent decision making and effective interoperability. In this paper, we model the system state transformation as a Markov decision process, and an actor-critic deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on a fuzzy normalized radial basis function neural network (called AC-FNRBF) is proposed to efficiently solve the intelligent transmission scheduling problem in CIoT systems under high-dimensional variables. The proposed AC-FNRBF algorithm can better approximate both the action function of the actor and the state-action value function of the critic without requiring the system prior knowledge, and a new reward function is established to maximize the system benefit, which jointly takes the transmission packet rate, the system throughput, the power consumption, and the transmission delay into account. Moreover, the AC-FNRBF has the ability to adjust its learning structure and parameters in dynamic environments. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm achieves higher transmission packet rate and system throughput with lower power consumption and transmission delay, compared with other existing reinforcement learning algorithms. © 2007-2012 IEEE.","Funding text 1: Manuscript received August 6, 2018; revised October 29, 2018 and December 22, 2018; accepted January 5, 2019.

To guarantee better QoS for citizens, smart cities leverage emerging technologies such as the Cognitive Radio Internet of Things (CR-IoT). However, resource allocation is a great challenge for CR-IoT, mainly because of the extremely numerous devices and users. Generally, the auction theory and game theory are applied to overcome the challenge. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm to learn the optimal resource allocation strategy in the oligopoly market model. Firstly, we model a multi-agent scenario with the primary users (PUs) as sellers and secondary users (SUs) as buyers. Then, we propose the Q-probabilistic multi-agent learning (QPML) and apply it to allocate resources in the market. In the multi-agent learning process, the PUs and SUs learn strategies to maximize their benefits and improve spectrum utilization. The performance of QPML is compared with Learning Automation (LA) through simulations. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms other approaches and performs well. © 2015 IEEE.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074500247,Yes,China,IoT and Edge Computing,Smart Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,Resource Allocation,Develop market-based model in cognitive radio IoT using Q-probabilistic multi-agent reinforcement learning for smart cities,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

In centralized computational systems, hyperparameter optimization and regularization techniques such as dropout are computational means to enhance learning performance by adjusting the deep hierarchical structure. However, in decentralized deep learning by the Internet of Things, the structure is an actual network of autonomous interconnected devices such as smart phones that interact via complex network protocols. Self-adaptation of the learning structure is a challenge. Uncertainties such as network latency, node and link failures or even bottlenecks by limited processing capacity and energy availability can significantly downgrade learning performance. Network self-organization and self-management is complex, while it requires additional computational and network resources that hinder the feasibility of decentralized deep learning.

The dominant ecosystem in Laoshan is forest, its ecological position is extremely important. This study aims to analyze the dynamic changes of the landscape pattern in the scenic area for the past 17 years. Local land use information based on Landsat images from 2001, 2005, 2009, 2013 and 2017 was extracted, using the technical method of object-oriented fuzzy classification, C5.0 decision tree classification, pixel-based maximum likelihood, artificial neural network and support vector machine. In addition, Fragstats 4.2 software was used to extract multiple landscape pattern indexes, for the comparison of dynamic landscape pattern from 2001 to 2017. Results show that the object-oriented fuzzy classification method had the highest overall accuracy (91.79%) and Kappa coefficient was 0.83. With the continuous construction and reform, the degree of landscape fragmentation in Laoshan scenic area has deepened. From 2001 to 2017, the number of patches (NP) showed an increasing trend, and reached 653 in 2017, with the patch density of 5.928 1 blocks·km-2. In 2017, contagion index (CONTAG) increased compared with that of 2001, reaching 59.41%, and the connectivity of dominant patch types has improved. The Shannon's diversity index (SHDI) value fluctuated in a narrow range, reaching a maximum of 0.725 5 in 2009. With the development of construction to a mature state, the overall development process slowly enters into an orderly state, and scenic area in Laoshan has gradually developed towards harmony and stability. © 2020, China Environmental Science Press.

In this research, according to the PSR framework-based land status of Yuxi City, an evaluation index system has been built up to reveal the changes of the land ecological security and analyze the causes of the variations from 2001 to 2015 in Yuxi City. This system is composed of three layers--direction layer, criterion layer which further consists of pressure, status and response, and index layer with 20 indices covering the various aspects of land use, society, economy and environment. In this paper, the genetic algorithm (GA) is introduced to improve the BP neural network, with advantages in solving the problems of slow convergence and getting into local minimum easily when the BP neural network was applied alone in land ecological security evaluation. A GA-BP neural network is then established to evaluate the land ecological security from 2001 to 2015. Comparisons between the BP neural network and the GA-BP neural network are drawn in their performances and errors and the assessment results of both are further separately compared with the target results of the comprehensive index method. The results show that: (1) The land ecological security index increases steadily from 0.3696 to 0.6020 and the security grade ascends from risky (IV) to safe (II) from 2001 to 2015 in Yuxi City; (2) Compared to the traditional BP neural network, the GA-BP neural network has less errors in training and predicting, and it is faster in convergence and higher accuracy in assessing results. Therefore, the GA-BP neural network model is not only able to function as well as the BP neural network in land ecological evaluation and prediction, it can obtain more accurate results and has faster convergence ability as well. © 2020 International Association of Engineers.","This work is supported by the Surface Project of Science and Technology Agency in Yunnan Province (Nos.2017FH001-045, 2018FH001-012), the Scientific Research Foundation of Yunnan Province Education Department (No. 2017ZDX134), P.R.

The influx of health-related queries and the volume of answers within the medical forums is a testimony to this adaption. The scalability, natural interaction and dynamism of the continuously collected and connected user-generated social big data can support health assessment, intervention and provisioning to produce the best kind of cognitive smart city. On the flip side the use of social media for healthcare communication suffers from data deluge, lack of reliability and quality, confidentiality and privacy (location/personal) issues. Duplicate questions, that is, queries with similar semantics (meaning) corrupt the filtering mechanism, increase the response time and compromise with the quality of the answer too. This research puts forward solutions to resolve the key challenge of duplicacy within the medical community Question-Answering sites (Medical CQAs). We propose to solve the semantic question matching problem for duplicate question pair detection, using a hybrid deep learning model, which combines a Co-attention based Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) Siamese neural network and a Multi-layer perceptron classifier to output the probability of a similarity match between the two questions. Euclidean distance function is then used to compute the similarity between questions. The proposed model is validated on 100 question pairs which are scrapped from three featured groups, namely, ‘Irritable Bowel Syndrome’, ‘Anxiety Disorder’ and ‘Menopause’ of Patient.info community forum and an accuracy of 86.375% is observed.

It is an important step for extracting objects from remote-sensing images, and provides a reliable theoretical basis for key property monitoring, environmental monitoring, disaster monitoring, and agricultural monitoring. To improve the accuracy of object segmentation and to solve the problem of inadequate edge recognition, a joint-learning segmentation scheme was designed that combines the conditional random field (CRF) model with an improved U-net model. It employs the improved U-net model as the front-end model of the joint-learning framework for feature fusion and the CRF model as the back-end of the joint-learning framework for transforming to gradient optimization-based recurrent neural networks. The joint-learning framework enables the front and back parts to interact with each other to obtain the location of the target and its classification information accurately. The joint-learning framework was realized on open datasets and compared with state-of-the-art remote-sensing image segmentation algorithms.

Based on this concept, vehicles can be used as code disseminators. That is, infrastructures of a smart city can be upgraded by receiving updated program codes that are disseminated by vehicles in the VSNs. Specifically, vehicles in the 5G network are hard to be managed. Under this domain, safety of program codes is a key challenge. Meanwhile, improving coverage of program codes is also challenging. However, arranging plenty of vehicles as code disseminators will incur large costs of the ground control station (GCS). Therefore, by utilizing machine learning methods, this paper proposes a “Machine Learning based Code Dissemination by Selecting Reliability Mobile Vehicles in 5G Networks” (MLCD) scheme to choose vehicles with higher reliable degree and coverage ratio as code disseminators to deliver code with lower costs. Firstly, reliable degrees of vehicles are calculated and selected to improve safety degree of code disseminations. Secondly, vehicles with higher coverage ratio are preferred to promise code coverage. Thirdly, machine learning methods are utilized to select vehicles with both higher coverage ratios and reliable degrees as code disseminators with limited costs. Compared to random-selection and coverage-only scheme respectively, the MLCD scheme can improve safety degree of code dissemination process by 83.6% and 18.86% in 5G networks, and can improve coverage ratio of updated information by 23.16%. Comprehensive performances of the proposed scheme can be improved by 80.56% and 17.25% respectively.

Traditional methods of assessing built environment characteristics are time-consuming and difficult to combine or compare. Google Street View (GSV) images represent a large, publicly available data source that can be used to create indicators of characteristics of the physical environment with machine learning techniques. The aim of this study is to use GSV images to measure the association of built environment features with health-related behaviors and outcomes at the census tract level. Methods: We used computer vision techniques to derive built environment indicators from approximately 31 million GSV images at 7.8 million intersections. Associations between derived indicators and health-related behaviors and outcomes on the census-tract level were assessed using multivariate regression models, controlling for demographic factors and socioeconomic position. Statistical significance was assessed at the α = 0.05 level. Results: Single lane roads were associated with increased diabetes and obesity, while non-single-family home buildings were associated with decreased obesity, diabetes and inactivity. Street greenness was associated with decreased prevalence of physical and mental distress, as well as decreased binge drinking, but with increased obesity. Socioeconomic disadvantage was negatively associated with binge drinking prevalence and positively associated with all other health-related behaviors and outcomes. Conclusions: Structural determinants of health such as the built environment can influence population health. Our study suggests that higher levels of urban development have mixed effects on health and adds further evidence that socioeconomic distress has adverse impacts on multiple physical and mental health outcomes. © 2020 The Author(s).","This study was supported by grant number R01 LM012849 (PI: QCN) from the National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health.

Here, we further quantitatively explore the effects of socioeconomic factors on landscape fragmentation.[Method]Multi data sources (e.g., Landsat-5 TM imagery with 30 m spatial resolution, and the Statistical Yearbook of Yangzhou City) and several data analysis methods (e.g., landscape pattern analysis and the boosted regression trees machine learning technique) were employed.[Result]① Arable land was the dominant land use, covering 54.9% of the total area of the city in 2010, followed by water (22.0%), built-up land (21.9%), and forestland and grassland (1.1%). As the distance from the city center increased, the degree of landscape fragmentation first increased and then decreased, where- by the turning point was at the edge of the city. ② The degree of landscape fragmentation increased with increasing level of urbanization, and reached an extremum at 35%-45% before declining gradually. ③ At the landscape level, social factors (i.e., total population and population density) generally had an inhibiting role on landscape fragmentation, while economic factors (i.e., per capita GDP, per capita revenue, primary and tertiary industries) usually promoted landscape fragmentation. In comparison to landscape level, socioeconomic factors had greater impacts at the class-level, and their relationships with class-level fragmentation indices (patch density, edge density, landscape division index and aggrega- tion index) showed distinct differences. For example, per capita revenue promoted the division of landscape at the land- scape level, but inhibited it at class level. [Conclusion] Socioeconomic development played an important role in landscape fragmentation, not only at different levels (landscape and class levels), but also in terms of different driving roles (inhibition or promotion) of fragmentation indices. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the scale effect, impact intensity, and impact direction of socioeconomic factors in order to effectively alleviate urban landscape fragmentation. © 2020 The authors.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107980362,Yes,China,Land Use,Urban Planning,Urban Development & Land Use,Spatial Analysis,Measurement/Analysis,Quantitatively explore effects of socioeconomic factors on landscape fragmentation in Yangzhou City,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Past,Longitudinal,Medium

Based on Wuhan high-resolution aerial and satellite remote sensing images and corresponding GIS vector data, we propose a novel convolutional neural network to apply in the urban land cover classification and change detection. Firstly, a fully atrous convolutional neural network (FACNN) is proposed, which could take into account the different scale and LOD (level of detail) of polygons in the GIS vector data. Then, both pixel-based change detection and object-based change detection are analyzed according to the classification maps from FACNN and a previous GIS map. Finally, the effectiveness and advantage of our method are verified by the classification and change detection experiments in very high resolution remote sensing images of Wuhan city covering more than 8 000 km2. The proposed FACNN proved outperforming mainstream CNN based methods as FCN-16, U-Net, and Dense-Net, and the precision of the object-based change detection achieved 74.1% and the recall was 96.4%, indicating application prospects for unban GIS map updating. © 2020, Research and Development Office of Wuhan University.

To assess NO<inf>2</inf> levels with high accuracy, we propose the use of an ensemble model to integrate multiple machine learning algorithms, including neural network, random forest, and gradient boosting, with a variety of predictor variables, including chemical transport models. This NO<inf>2</inf> model covers the entire contiguous U.S. with daily predictions on 1-km-level grid cells from 2000 to 2016. The ensemble produced a cross-validated R2 of 0.788 overall, a spatial R2 of 0.844, and a temporal R2 of 0.729. The relationship between daily monitored and predicted NO<inf>2</inf> is almost linear. We also estimated the associated monthly uncertainty level for the predictions and address-specific NO<inf>2</inf> levels. This NO<inf>2</inf> estimation has a very high spatiotemporal resolution and allows the examination of the health effects of NO<inf>2</inf> in unmonitored areas. We found the highest NO<inf>2</inf> levels along highways and in cities. We also observed that nationwide NO<inf>2</inf> levels declined in early years and stagnated after 2007, in contrast to the trend at monitoring sites in urban areas, where the decline continued.

However, owing to the typical disruption of cellular and Internet connectivity during disasters, the possibility of transmitting situational information using conventional communication infrastructure is almost ruled out. The networking research community has strongly proposed the use of delay tolerant networks (DTN) in such challenged network scenario. In this article, we exploit the movement of volunteers carrying smartphones in such a scenario to form a DTN and propose a utility-based DropBox deployment scheme toward improving post-disaster situational information exchange. In this scheme, Drop-Boxes are deployed across the network at high utility locations. Since the effectiveness of the proposed scheme can be evaluated accurately considering an appropriate post-disaster mobility model suitable for smart cities, we present a human movement model for a post-disaster scenario in a smart city. This movement model is shown to have better performance over other competing movement models in a post-disaster smart city environment. An extensive simulation is performed using ONE simulator to evaluate the comparative performance of the proposed DropBox deployment scheme with some state-of-the-art existing deployment schemes using the presented movement model.

Intelligent systems and applications often automate decisions based on the outcome of certain machine learning models. They collaborate at an ever increasing scale, ranging from smart homes and smart factories to smart cities. The best performing machine learning model, its architecture and parameters for a given task are ideally automatically determined through a hyperparameter tuning process. At the same time, edge computing is an emerging distributed computing paradigm that aims to bring computation and data storage closer to the location where they are needed to save network bandwidth or reduce the latency of requests. The challenge we address in this work is that hyperparameter tuning does not take into consideration resource trade-offs when selecting the best model for deployment in smart environments. The most accurate model might be prohibitively expensive to computationally evaluate on a resource constrained node at the edge of the network. We propose a multi-objective optimization solution to find acceptable trade-offs between model accuracy and resource consumption to enable the deployment of machine learning models in resource constrained smart environments. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by means of an anomaly detection use case. Additionally, we evaluate the extent that transfer learning techniques can be applied to reduce the amount of training required by reusing previous models, parameters and trade-off points from similar settings. © 2020 by the authors.

An ensemble approach was then implemented to predict hazard probabilities using the best machine learning algorithms (boosted regression tree, multivariate adaptive regression spline, generalized linear model, and generalized additive model) based on a receiver operator characteristic-area under the curve (ROC-AUC) assessment. The algorithms were all trained and tested on 92 randomly selected points, information from a flood inundation survey, and geospatial predictor variables (precipitation, land use, elevation, slope percent, curve number, distance to river, distance to channel, and depth to groundwater). The ensemble model had 0.925 and 0.892 accuracy for training and testing data, respectively. We then created a vulnerability map from data on building density, building age, population density, and socio-economic conditions and assessed risk as a product of hazard and vulnerability. The results indicated that distance to channel, land use, and runoff generation were the most important factors associated with flood hazard, while population density and building density were the most important factors determining vulnerability.

Firstly, under the guidance of user behavior cognition, the characteristics of multi-channel information resources in a VR system were analyzed, and the correlation matrix of the VR system scenario resource characteristics was constructed based on the design criteria of human-computer interaction, cognition, and low-load demand. Secondly, analytic hierarchy process (AHP)-QFD combined with evaluation matrix is used to output the priority ranking of VR system resource characteristics. Then, the VR system task scenario cognitive load experiment is carried out on users, and the CNN input set and output set data are collected through the experiment, in order to build a CNN system and predict the user cognitive load and satisfaction in the human-computer interaction in the VR system. Finally, combined with the task information interface of a VR system in a smart city, the application research of the system resource feature optimization method under multi-channel cognition is carried out. The results show that the test coefficient CR value of the AHP-QFD model based on cognitive load is less than 0.1, and the MSE of CNN prediction model network is 0.004247, which proves the effectiveness of this model. According to the requirements of the same design task in a VR system, by comparing the scheme formed by the traditional design process with the scheme optimized by the method in this paper, the results show that the user has a lower cognitive load and better task operation experience when interacting with the latter scheme, so the optimization method studied in this paper can provide a reference for the system construction of virtual reality. © 2020 by the authors.

This contribution outlines AI-based techniques for 3D point clouds and geospatial digital twins as generic components of geospatial AI. First, we briefly reflect on the term “AI” and outline technology developments needed to apply AI to IT solutions, seen from a software engineering perspective. Next, we characterize 3D point clouds as key category of geodata and their role for creating the basis for geospatial digital twins; we explain the feasibility of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches for 3D point clouds. In particular, we argue that 3D point clouds can be seen as a corpus with similar properties as natural language corpora and formulate a “Naturalness Hypothesis” for 3D point clouds. In the main part, we introduce a workflow for interpreting 3D point clouds based on ML/DL approaches that derive domain-specific and application-specific semantics for 3D point clouds without having to create explicit spatial 3D models or explicit rule sets. Finally, examples are shown how ML/DL enables us to efficiently build and maintain base data for geospatial digital twins such as virtual 3D city models, indoor models, or building information models. © 2020, The Author(s).","Open Access funding provided by Projekt DEAL.

Such land-cover change generally entails negative implications for societal and environmental sustainability, particularly in South Asia, where high demographic growth and poor land-use planning combine. Analyzing historical land-use change and predicting the future trends concerning urban expansion may support more effective land-use planning and sustainable outcomes. For Nepal's Tarai region-a populous area experiencing land-use change due to urbanization and other factors-we draw on Landsat satellite imagery to analyze historical land-use change focusing on urban expansion during 1989-2016 and predict urban expansion by 2026 and 2036 using artificial neural network (ANN) and Markov chain (MC) spatial models based on historical trends. Urban cover quadrupled since 1989, expanding by 256 km2 (460%), largely as small scattered settlements. This expansion was almost entirely at the expense of agricultural conversion (249 km2). After 2016, urban expansion is predicted to increase linearly by a further 199 km2 by 2026 and by another 165 km2 by 2036, almost all at the expense of agricultural cover. Such unplanned loss of prime agricultural lands in Nepal's fertile Tarai region is of serious concern for food-insecure countries like Nepal. © 2020 by the author.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85080964724,Yes,Nepal,Urban Planning and Development,Urban Planning,Urban Development & Land Use,Land Change Modeling,Prediction/Forecasting,Analyze patterns of historical and future urban expansion in Nepal at the cost of agricultural and forested lands,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities; SDG 15: Life on Land,Empirical,Quantitative,National,Future,Longitudinal,Medium

The main challenges faced by cities currently and towards the future are the rapid urbanization, the increase in urban temperature and the urban heat island. Mapping and monitoring urban fabric (UF) to analyze the environmental impact of these phenomena is more necessary than ever. This coupled with the increased availability of Earth observation data and their growing temporal capabilities leads us to consider using temporal features for improving land use classification, especially in urban environments where the spectral overlap between classes makes it challenging. Urban land use classification thus remains a central question in remote sensing. Although some research studies have successfully used multi-temporal images such as Landsat-8 or Sentinel-2 to improve land cover classification, urban land use mapping is rarely carried using the temporal dimension. This paper explores the use of Sentinel-2 data in a deep learning framework, by firstly assessing the temporal robustness of four popular fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) trained over single-date images for the classification of the urban footprint, and secondly, by proposing a multi-temporal FCN. A performance comparison between the proposed framework and a regular FCN is also conducted. In this study, we consider four UF classes typical of many European Western cities. Results show that training the proposed multi-date model on Sentinel 2 multi-temporal data achieved the best results with a Kappa coefficient increase of 2.72% and 6.40%, respectively for continuous UF and industrial facilities. Although a more definitive conclusion requires further testing, first results are promising because they confirm that integrating the temporal dimension with a high spatial resolution into urban land use classification may be a valuable strategy to discriminate among several urban categories. © 2020 by the authors.","This research was funded by the French funded project ANR TIMES 'High-performance processing techniques for mapping and monitoring environmental changes from massive, heterogeneous and high frequency data times series' (ANR-17-CE23-0015-01) and the CNES TOSCA program 2018.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85080903816,Yes,Morocco,Remote Sensing,Urban Planning,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Deep Learning,Classification,Develop multi-temporal deep learning approach for mapping urban fabric using Sentinel 2 images to monitor urbanization,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Past,Longitudinal,Medium

As an indoor positioning technology of the Internet of things, it changes with each passing day and shows great vitality in the development of smart cities. Aiming at the problem that existing radio frequency identification indoor positioning algorithm is prone to environmental interference and poor positioning accuracy, a LANDMARC indoor positioning algorithm based on density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise–genetic algorithm–radial basis function neural network is proposed. In this article, the signal intensity value is processed by Gaussian filter, and the noise points and boundary points are removed by density-based clustering algorithm. The threshold and weight of radial basis function neural network were optimized by genetic algorithm. With less data information, the relationship between the value of label signal strength and position coordinate could be established to improve the positioning accuracy of LANDMARC positioning algorithm. Experimental research shows that the average positioning error of the proposed LANDMARC algorithm based on density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise–genetic algorithm–radial basis function neural network is about 0.9 m, which is 64% lower than the average positioning error of the traditional LANDMARC algorithm and improves the indoor positioning accuracy. © The Author(s) 2020.","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61871348 and open foundation of laboratory (2018JYWXTX02).",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85080885877,Yes,China,Indoor Positioning,Smart Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"RBF Neural Network, DBSCAN, Genetic Algorithm",Prediction/Forecasting,Develop LANDMARC indoor positioning algorithm based on DBSCAN-GA-RBF neural network for smart city IoT applications,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Weak

Often, these IoT applications fall in the domain of reinforcement learning (RL), e.g., autonomous robot navigation in smart factories and traffic signal control in smart cities. However, RL-based applications require a long learning time. To overcome this limitation and scale with the number of agents, parallel RL (PRL) algorithms run multiple RL agents in parallel and on distributed environments. However, deploying PRL algorithms in such environments entails a communication overhead that increases the (actual) execution time. The state-of-the-art PRL algorithms are designed for reducing the learning time while assuming no (or limited) communication overhead. In this article, we present a novel partitioning algorithm that minimizes the communication overhead in PRL running on IoT environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses on solving the communication overhead of distributing PRL algorithms without requiring any a priori knowledge about the structure of the problem. The proposed algorithm intelligently combines a dynamic state partitioning strategy, which exploits the agent's exploration capabilities to build partition knowledge while learning, with an efficient mapping of agents to partitions, which reduces the communication among agents. Performance evaluations show that the proposed algorithm can achieve almost no communication among PRL agents at the converged state. © 2014 IEEE.","Funding text 1: Manuscript received October 29, 2018; revised June 10, 2019 and October 3, 2019; accepted November 9, 2019.

After analyzing the currently available solutions, this paper proposes an IoT-based low-cost system employing machine learning techniques to monitor water quality in real time, analyze water quality trends and detect anomalous events such as intentional contamination of water. © IWA Publishing 2020",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079394989,Yes,Pakistan,Water and Wastewater,Environmental Quality,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,"Machine Learning, IoT",Monitoring,Review water quality monitoring from conventional to emerging IoT and ML technologies for smart cities,SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation; SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Review/Survey,Qualitative,Global,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

The increased computing capacity of the nodes that create the network is allowing the addition of processing algorithms and artificial intelligence that provide more information about the sound sources and environment, e.g., detect sound events or calculate loudness. Several models to predict sound pressure levels in cities are available, mainly road, railway and aerial traffic noise. However, these models are mostly based in auxiliary data, e.g., vehicles flow or street geometry, and predict equivalent levels for a temporal long-term. Therefore, forecasting of temporal short-term sound levels could be a helpful tool for urban planners and managers. In this work, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep neural network technique is proposed to model temporal behavior of sound levels at a certain location, both sound pressure level and loudness level, in order to predict near-time future values. The proposed technique can be trained for and integrated in every node of a sensor network to provide novel functionalities, e.g., a method of early warning against noise pollution and of backup in case of node or network malfunction. To validate this approach, one-minute period equivalent sound levels, captured in a two-month measurement campaign by a node of a deployed network of acoustic sensors, have been used to train it and to obtain different forecasting models. Assessments of the developed LSTM models and Auto regressive integrated moving average models were performed to predict sound levels for several time periods, from 1 to 60 min. Comparison of the results show that the LSTM models outperform the statistics-based models. In general, the LSTM models achieve a prediction of values with a mean square error less than 4.3 dB for sound pressure level and less than 2 phons for loudness. Moreover, the goodness of fit of the LSTM models and the behavior pattern of the data in terms of prediction of sound levels are satisfactory. © 2020 by the authors.

This study adopted the use of remote sensing technique and geographical information system (GIS) to analyse the relationship between changing land use/land cover and land surface temperature in a rapidly urbanizing tropical city of Ibadan between 1984 and 2019. Landsat series TM, ETM+, and OLI satellite imageries of Ibadan region city for 1984, 2002, and 2019, respectively, were obtained from the US Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat series of Earth Observation satellites accessible on the Google earth engine (GEE) platform. Supervised classification was done using a random forest (RF) machine learning classifier in the GEE platform. Surface emissivity maps were obtained from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) thresholds method and land cover information. The surface emissivity based on NDVI classes was used to retrieve land surface temperature (LST). The results showed an increase in urban cover from 341.72 km2 in 1984 to 520.58 km2 in 2019 with an average increase in land surface temperature from 17 °C to 38 °C, respectively. Temperature sampling in the north-south and west-east transect revealed that highly urbanized areas located at the city centre of Ibadan have the highest LST of about 38 °C. It dissipates to about 19 °C at the suburb that is less built up. A significant negative relationship exists between the health condition of vegetation (NDVI) and LST with a correlation coefficient of r = − 0.95. The study confirms the potential application of GIS and remote sensing for detecting urban growth as well as relates growth impact to LST, thereby suggesting that fitting strategies will be important for the sustainable management of the urban areas. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077786242,Yes,Nigeria,Urban Climate,Environmental Quality,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,"Remote Sensing, GIS",Measurement/Analysis,Analyze relationship between changing land use/land cover and land surface temperature in Ibadan using remote sensing and GIS,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities; SDG 13: Climate Action,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Past,Longitudinal,Strong

However, despite substantial efforts in recent decades, large-scale 30-m land cover maps still suffer from relatively low accuracy in terms of land cover type discrimination (especially for the vegetation and impervious types), due to limits in relation to the data, method, and design of the workflow. In this work, we improved the land cover classification accuracy by integrating free and public high-resolution Google Earth images (HR-GEI) with Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery. Our major innovation is a hybrid approach that includes three major components: (1) a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based classifier that extracts high-resolution features from Google Earth imagery; (2) traditional machine learning classifiers (i.e., Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) that are based on spectral features extracted from 30-m Landsat data; and (3) an ensemble decision maker that takes all different features into account. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 84.40% on the entire validation dataset in China, improving the previous state-of-the-art accuracies obtained by RF and SVM by 4.50% and 4.20%, respectively. Moreover, our proposed method reduces misclassifications between certain vegetation types, and improves identification of the impervious type. Evaluation applied over an area of around 14,000 km2 confirms little improvement for land cover types (e.g., forest) of which the classification accuracies are already over 80% when using traditional machine learning approaches, yet improvements in accuracy of 7% for cropland and shrubland, 9% for grassland, 23% for impervious and 25% for wetlands were achieved when compared with traditional machine learning approaches. The results demonstrate the great potential of integrating features of datasets at different resolutions and the possibility to produce more reliable land cover maps. © 2019","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFA0604401), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51761135015 and U1839206), Center for High Performance Computing and System Simulation, Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao), and Cyrus Tang Foundation and a donation by Delos LLC to Tsinghua University.; Funding text 2: This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFA0604401 ), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51761135015 and U1839206 ), Center for High Performance Computing and System Simulation, Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao), and Cyrus Tang Foundation and a donation by Delos LLC to Tsinghua University.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075775137,Yes,China,Land Use,Urban Planning,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"Image Fusion, Classification",Classification,Integrate Google Earth imagery with Landsat data to improve 30-m resolution land cover mapping for city planning,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based method considering the connectivity of pixels for automatic pavement crack detection which has the potential to complement the current practice involving visual inspection which is costly, inefficient and time-consuming. In the proposed method, the convolutional layers are densely connected in a feed-forward fashion to reuse features from multiple layers, and transposed convolution layers are used for multiple level feature fusion. A novel loss function considering the connectivity of pixels is introduced to overcome the issues related to the output of transposed convolution layers. The proposed method is tested on two datasets, where the first one is collected from a handheld smartphone and the second one is collected from a high-speed camera mounted on the rear of a moving car.

The quality of assessments can be augmented by modelling; however, models are generally less capable of predicting PNC spatial variation than predicting variations in other ambient pollutants. To advance modelling of PNC, we aimed to develop and compare the performance of parametric and non-parametric machine learning land-use regression (LUR) models to predict hourly average PNC. We used data from 25 short-term stationary campaigns and five long-term sites during 2009–2012 in the Brisbane Metropolitan Area, Australia. We analysed three particle size ranges of total PNC (<30 nm, <414 nm and <3000 nm) as response variables, and over 150 independent variables, including land use, roads and traffic, population, distance, elevation, meteorology and time of day as potential predictors of PNC. The LUR models were developed separately for All Days, Nuc Days (when particle nucleation occurred), and No-nuc Days (when no particle nucleation occurred). We selected two algorithms to develop LUR models for PNC: a random forest (RF) model, and a generalised additive model (GAM) based on the least angle regression (LARS). The best LARS model for <30 nm, <414 nm and <3000 nm explained 30%, 31%, and 34%, respectively, whereas the best RF models were significantly better, explaining 73%, 64%, and 88%, respectively. Using this novel approach, we provided new insights into spatial variation in PNC and also demonstrated that the non-parametric RF model is a better choice for developing a LUR model for PNCs because of its robust predictive performance in comparison with the LARS parametric regression model. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","This work was supported by the Australian Research Council (ARC) , Department of Transport and Main Roads (DTMR) and Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) through Linkage Grant LP0990134 .

This approach strengthens comparisons when the built environment is a potential confounder, as in many injury research studies. Methods As an example, I apply this method to study the spatial influence of alcohol outlets (AOs) on firearm violence in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, specifically beer stores and bar/restaurants. Using a case-control framework, city blocks with shootings in 2017-2018 were matched with similar-looking blocks with no shootings, based on analysis with a pretrained convolutional neural network and t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding. Logistic regression was used to estimate the OR of a shooting on the same block as an AO and within one-block and two-block distances, conditional on additional factors such as land use, demographic composition and illegal drug activity. Results The case-control matches were similar in visual appearance, on human inspection, and were well balanced on covariate measures. The fully adjusted model estimated an increased shootings risk for locations with beer stores within one block, OR=1.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.1, p=0.02, and locations with bar/restaurants on the same block, OR=1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.4, p=0.02. Conclusion These findings align with previous study findings while addressing the concern that AOs might systematically be located in certain kinds of environments, providing stronger evidence of a causal effect on nearby firearm violence. Matching on visual similarity can improve observational injury studies involving place-based risks. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

Video summarization tends to detect important visual data from the surveillance stream and can help in efficient indexing and retrieval of required data from huge surveillance datasets. In this research article, we propose an efficient convolutional neural network based summarization method for surveillance videos of resource-constrained devices. Shot segmentation is considered as a backbone of video summarization methods and it affects the overall quality of the generated summary. Thus, we propose an effective shot segmentation method using deep features. Furthermore, our framework maintains the interestingness of the generated summary using image memorability and entropy. Within each shot, the frame with highest memorability and entropy score is considered as a keyframe.

The present study deals with multi-temporal satellite data along with statistical models to map and monitor the LULC change patterns and prediction of urban expansion in the upcoming years for one of the important cities of Ganga alluvial Plain. With the help of our study, we also tried to portray the impact of urban sprawl on the natural environment. The long-term LULC and urban spatial change modelling was carried out using Landsat satellite data from 2001 to 2016. The assessment of the outcome showed that increase in urban built-up areas favoured a substantial decline in the agricultural land and rural built-up areas, from 2001 to 2016. Shannon’s entropy index was also used to measure the spatial growth patterns over the period of time in the study area based on the land-use change statistics. Prediction of the future land-use growth of the study area for 2019, 2022 and 2031 was carried out using artificial neural network method through Quantum GIS software. Results of the simulation model revealed that 14.7% of urban built-up areas will increase by 2019, 15.7% by 2022 and 18.68% by 2031. The observation received from the present study based on the long-term classification of satellite data, statistical methods and field survey indicates that the predicted LULC map of the area will be precious information for policy and decision-makers for sustainable urban development and natural resource management in the area for food and water security. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052060501,Yes,India,Land Use,Urban Planning,Urban Development & Land Use,"Statistical Models, Earth Observation",Prediction/Forecasting,Monitor spatial LULC changes and growth prediction based on statistical models and earth observation in Gautam Budh Nagar,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Longitudinal,Medium

Internet of thing (IoT) and Smart City deployments are generating large amounts of time-series sensor data in need of analysis. Applying deep learning to these domains has been an important topic of research. The Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network has been proven to be well suited for dealing with and predicting important events with long intervals and delays in the time series. LTSM networks have the ability to maintain long-term memory. In an LTSM network, a stacked LSTM hidden layer also makes it possible to learn a high level temporal feature without the need of any fine tuning and preprocessing which would be required by other techniques. In this paper, we construct a long-short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network structure, use the normal time series training set to build the prediction model. And then we use the predicted error from the prediction model to construct a Gaussian naive Bayes model to detect whether the original sample is abnormal. This method is called LSTM-Gauss-NBayes for short. We use three real-world data sets, each of which involve long-term time-dependence or short-term time-dependence, even very weak time dependence. The experimental results show that LSTM-Gauss-NBayes is an effective and robust model. © 2019 SERSC.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083546043,Yes,India,IoT and Edge Computing,Smart Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Recurrent Neural Network (RNN),Anomaly Detection,Develop efficient anomaly detection using RNN for IoT and smart city time-series sensor data,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

The sensing resources of the geospatial sensor web are of multiple sources, heterogeneity, and dispersion. These characteristics result in the grand technical challenges of sharing and managing heterogeneous resources, real-time access of geospatial information with multiple protocols, spatiotemporally seamless and autonomous sensing of geospatial information, and accurate prediction of key parameters, especially when facing the personalized, instant, and smart application needs of multi-level users. It is hard for static geographical information service to meet the demands of geo-events for integrated monitoring, early warning and decision support, and focusing application. Therefore, there are urgent needs to develop fusion service technologies of the geospatial sensor web, as well as real-time dynamic geographical information service platforms. To solve these problems, this paper proposed online access, integrated management, space-ground fusion, spatiotemporal prediction, and focusing service models and methods. With the online access, dynamic management methods for sensing spectrum resources, and transparent access methods based on heterogeneous sensor protocols pool were proposed; a cyber-physical spatiotemporal information service environment was established, which realized the efficient access of spatiotemporal information with heterogeneous protocols. With the integrated management, sharable and interoperable information models including sensor observation process information description model, observation data description model, observation event description model, and dynamic observation capability index model were proposed, which tackled the coupling problem of sensor web and GIS, and realized large-scale integrated management and sharing of space-air-ground-sea platforms and sensors for the integrated monitoring of fairway, hydrology, soil, meteorology, and ocean. With space-ground fusion, a point-surface-collaboration and seamless reconstruction model, and evaluation-collaboration-reconstruction, cross-scale, seamless and continuous sensing methods were proposed, which improved the sensing quality by 14 times with respect to using satellite only and meanwhile keeping sensing frequency the same as the station networks, providing new ways for continuous monitoring of resources, environments, and disasters. For spatiotemporal predictions, ensemble models of multiple machine learning models, ensemble models of statistical models and dynamic models, and a spatiotemporal deep learning model were proposed, which realized high-resolution and high-precision predictions of meteorological parameters at regional scales. For the focusing service, a geo-control method based on instant sensing feedback, a time-continuous maximal covering location model, and an automatic aggregation sensing method were proposed, which improved the spatiotemporal coverage of sensing by 18%, and realized active and on-demand sensing of spatiotemporal information. Based on the sensor web observation information models and using the architecture of satellite-ground-collaboration spatiotemporal information sensing as a service, a geospatial sensor web spatiotemporal information sensing and service system named GeoSensor was developed, which has the functions of sensing, access, cognition, and control. The GeoSensor has been successfully applied to the sensing management and service of spatiotemporal information in the Yangtze River, the ocean and the smart city. In the future, the theory of smart sensing and cognition of people, water, and city will be further developed, the technology of crowd-sourced sensing, spatial intelligence, and cognition service of space-air-ground-sea-people will be developed, and large-scale applications in the Yangtze River Economic Zone will be conducted as well. © 2020, Science Press.

In many cases, due to a wide range of financial or installation limitations, off-grid small scale micro power panels are favoured as modular systems to power lighting in gardens or to be integrated together to power small devices such as mobile phone chargers and distributed smart city facilities and services. Manufacturers and systems’ integrators have a wide range of options of micro-scale photo voltaic panels to choose from. This makes the selection of the right panel a challenging task and risky investment. To address this and to help manufacturers, this paper suggests and evaluates a novel approach based on integrating empirical lab-testing with short-term real data and neural networks to assess the performance of micro-scale photovoltaic panels and their suitability for a specific application in specific environment. The paper outlines the combination of lab testing power output under seasonal and hourly conditions during the year combined with environmental and operating conditions such as temperature, dust accumulation and tilt angle performance. Based on the lab results, a short in-situ experimental work is implemented and the performance over the year in the selected location in Kuwait is evaluated using deep learning neural networks. The findings of this approach are compared with simulation and long-term real data. The results show a maximum error of 23% of the neural network output when compared with the actual data, and a correlation values with previous work within 87.3% and 91.9% which indicate that the proposed approach could provide an experimental rapid and accurate assessment of the expected power output. Hence, supporting the rapid decision-making process for manufacturers and reducing investment risks. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank Nottingham Trent University (NTU), UK and the Public Authority for Applied Education and Training, Kuwait for funding this work.

The study area is the city of Guangzhou, China, and based on a 96.6% matching rate for the interest point (POI) data, the village-level administrative unit is selected as the basic calculation unit of the study. Functional land type identification is performed using a deep network convolutional neural network, and semantic extraction of the remote sensing images is conducted. The extraction results and the POI data function land obtained by the sample density method undergo data reclassification and are assigned to an assignment model. The result is supplemented and verified. In accordance with the relevant policies and planning documents, an association is established between the functional land and the MFOZ, and the rules of interpretation for the functional area and MFOZ are developed. As the POI data is peculiar, an information entropy method with quantitative metric elements is used to analyze the degree of mixing of functional land use in Guangzhou, and the road network data is used to determine the regional traffic development to assist in judging the MFOZ. A cluster analysis of the functional land of the village-level administrative unit from the geographical space is performed by dividing Guangzhou City into five functional areas: core promotion zone, adjustment optimization zone, key expansion zone, moderate development zone, and prohibited development zone. The resulting zone map is compared with the draft of the Guangzhou Major Function Oriented Zoning Planning (2008-2020) document and the Guangzhou City Master Plan (2017-2035). We observe that the proposed method has a high accuracy and appropriately reflects the Major Function Oriented Zoning. The actual distribution of the functional area reflects the spatial pattern of Guangzhou: a core upgrading area dominated by the main urban area, an adjustment and optimization area mainly in the Panyu and Baiyun Districts, a large-scale expansion area dominated by the Huadu District and Huangpu, a moderate development zone dominated by the Conghua and Zengcheng Districts, and a prohibited construction zone. © 2021 Editorial Committee of Tropical Geography.

Since mixed pixels are a characteristic of medium resolution images such as Landsat, when used for the classification of urban areas, due to changes in urban ground cover within a pixel, Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) together with Super-Resolution Mapping (SRM) are employed to derive class fractions to generate classification maps at a higher spatial resolution using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) predicted Wavelet method. Landsat images over the two cities for a 30-year period, are classified in terms of vegetation, buildings, soil and water. The classifications are then processed using Indifrag software to assess the levels of fragmentation caused by changes in the areas of buildings, vegetation, water and soil over the 30 years. The extents of fragmentation of vegetation, buildings, water and soil for the two cities are compared, while the percentages of vegetation are compared with recommended percentages of green space for urban areas for the benefit of health and well-being of inhabitants. Changes in Ecosystem Service Values (ESVs) resulting from the urbanization have been assessed for Wuhan and Sydney.

Most of the time, image processing achieves significant performance under normal lighting conditions. However, under low-light conditions, an image turns out to be noisy and dark, which makes subsequent computer vision tasks difficult. To make buried details more visible, and reduce blur and noise in a low-light captured image, a low-light image enhancement task is necessary. A lot of research has been applied to many different techniques. However, most of these approaches require much effort or expensive equipment to perform low-light image enhancement. For example, the image has to be captured in a raw camera file in order to be processed, and the addressing method does not perform well under extreme low-light conditions. In this paper, we propose a new convolutional network, Attention U-net (the integration of an attention gate and a U-net network), which is able to work on common file types (.PNG,.JPEG,.JPG, etc.) with primary support from deep learning to solve the problem of surveillance camera security in smart city inducements without requiring the raw image file from the camera, and it can perform under the most extreme low-light conditions. © 2020 by the authors.

Standard k-fold cross-validation (KCV) techniques that attempt to measure the generalisation performance of machine learning and statistical algorithms are inappropriate in this setting due to their inherent i.i.d assumption, which is violated by spatial dependency. As such, more appropriate validation methods have been considered, notably blocking and spatial k-fold cross-validation (SKCV). However, the physical barriers and complex network structures which make up a city’s landscape mean that these methods are also inappropriate, largely because the travel patterns (and hence Spatial Autocorrelation (SAC)) in most urban spaces are rarely Euclidean in nature. To overcome this problem, we propose a new road distance and travel time k-fold cross-validation method, RT-KCV.

To achieve optimal signal timing, many studies have attempted to adjust green splits of a cycle time according to the distance between road intersections. However, existing green wave traffic control systems usually require a sophisticated calculation that depend upon the stability of vehicle speed and traffic flow, which can lead to weak robustness. Therefore, this article proposes two novel approaches to control arterial traffic coordination with the help of artificial intelligence: DDPG-BAND and ES-BAND. DDPG-BAND has two stages: a coarse-tuning stage reduces the blocking coefficient, and a fine-tuning stage optimizes the traffic evaluation index. ES-BAND introduces the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES), a scalable alternative to reinforcement learning, into signal timing. Different traffic variables are adopted as parameters to search for the optimal value by the CMA-ES. To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approaches, we import real traffic flow data from Zhongshan Road, Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China, into a traffic environment simulator for training and then conduct a series of experiments.

The development of machine learning technology led by deep learning drives its applications to healthcare services. However, the conventional deep learning models consume a lot of power and are difficult to miniaturize, so they are not suitable for wearable devices required by smart cities.

Change detection methods using high-resolution satellite images can be used to resolve various urban problems such as city planning and forecasting. For using pixel-based change detection, which is a conventional method such as Iteratively Reweighted-Multivariate Alteration Detection (IR-MAD), unchanged areas will be detected as changing areas because changes in pixels are sensitive to the state of the environment such as seasonal changes between images. Therefore, in this paper, to precisely detect the changes of the objects that consist of the city in time-series satellite images, the semantic spatial objects that consist of the city are defined, extracted through deep learning based image segmentation, and then analyzed the changes between areas to carry out change detection. The semantic objects for analyzing changes were defined as six classes: building, road, farmland, vinyl house, forest area, and waterside area. Each network model learned with KOMPSAT-3A satellite images performs a change detection for the time-series KOMPSAT-3 satellite images. For objective assessments for change detection, we use F1-score, kappa. We found that the proposed method gives a better performance compared to U-Net and UNet++ by achieving an average F1-score of 0.77, kappa of 77.29. © 2020 Korean Society of Remote Sensing.

Urban sprawl growth has been always also a worldwide concern that needs to carefully monitor particularly in a developing country where unplanned building constriction has been expanding at a high rate. Recently, remotely sensed imageries with a very high spatial/spectral resolution and state of the art machine learning approaches sent the urban classification and growth monitoring to a higher level. In this research, we classified the Quickbird satellite imagery by object-based image analysis of Dempster-Shafer (OBIA-DS) for the years of 2002 and 2015 at Karbala-Iraq. The real LULC changes including, residential sprawl expansion, amongst these years, were identified via change detection procedure. In accordance with extracted features of LULC and detected trend of urban pattern, the future LULC dynamic was simulated by using land transformation model (LTM) in geospatial information system (GIS) platform. Both classification and prediction stages were successfully validated using ground control points (GCPs) through accuracy assessment metric of Kappa coefficient that indicated 0.87 and 0.91 for 2002 and 2015 classification as well as 0.79 for prediction part. Detail results revealed a substantial growth in building over fifteen years that mostly replaced by agriculture and orchard field. The prediction scenario of LULC sprawl development for 2030 revealed a substantial decline in green and agriculture land as well as an extensive increment in build-up area especially at the countryside of the city without following the residential pattern standard. The proposed method helps urban decision-makers to identify the detail temporal-spatial growth pattern of highly populated cities like Karbala. Additionally, the results of this study can be considered as a probable future map in order to design enough future social services and amenities for the local inhabitants. © This is an Open-Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.",This work was supported by the Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program under Grant KMI2017-9060.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105640190,Yes,Australia,Land Use,Urban Planning,Urban Development & Land Use,"Dempster-Shafer, Land Transformation Model",Prediction/Forecasting,Extract land use features and predict sprawl development from Quickbird satellite imagery using Dempster-Shafer,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Longitudinal,Medium

Connected electronic devices are more common in smart buildings, smart cities, smart grids, and smart homes. The advancements in smart grid technologies have enabled to monitor every moment of energy consumption in smart buildings. The issue with smart devices is more energy consumption as compared to ordinary buildings. Due to smart cities and smart homes' growth rates, the demand for efficient resource management is also growing day by day. Energy is a vital resource, and its production cost is very high. Due to that, scientists and researchers are working on optimizing energy usage, especially in smart cities, besides providing a comfortable environment. The central focus of this paper is on energy consumption optimization in smart buildings or smart homes. For the comfort index (thermal, visual, and air quality), we have used three parameters, i.e., Temperature (F), illumination (lx), and CO2 (ppm). The major problem with the previous methods in the literature is the static user parameters (Temperature, illumination, and CO2); when they (parameters) are assigned at the beginning, they cannot be changed. In this paper, the Alpha Betafilter has been used to predict the indoor Temperature, illumination, and air quality and remove noise from the data. We applied a deep extreme learning machine approach to predict the user parameters.We have used the Bat algorithm and fuzzy logic to optimize energy consumption and comfort index management. The predicted user parameters have improved the system's overall performance in terms of ease of use of smart systems, energy consumption, and comfort index management. The comfort index after optimization remained near to 1, which proves the significance of the system. After optimization, the power consumption also reduced and stayed around the maximum of 15-18wh. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

This paper presents a novel approach to derive LST estimates by integrating machine learning algorithm and spatiotemporal fusion model at high spatial and temporal resolution. The spatial resolutions of Landsat TM and Landsat 8 LST data were first downscaled using random forest (RF) algorithm from 120 m and 100 m, respectively, to 30 m. The resultant LST data were fused with MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST data, by means of the Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion method (FSDAF), in order to generate high spatiotemporal resolution summer daytime LST data covering the center of Chengdu city in China. The proposed new method was used to estimate the spatiotemporal variations of the summer daytime SUHI from 2009 to 2018 over Chengdu city. Results show that: (1) RF performs way better than the classical downscaling algorithm-thermal sharpening algorithm (TsHARP) for LST, and produces higher accuracy for different land covers; (2) the fused high spatiotemporal resolution summer daytime LST values were evaluated with in situ LST obtained from Chengdu Meteorological Office and the final validation results indicated that the proposed method, in generating LST dataset, can provide more details of urban thermal environment and produce higher accuracy than the traditional FSDAF; (3) significantly increasing trends of summer daytime SUHI intensity (SUHII) in the study area were observed. SUHII increased from 2.78 °C in 2009 to 4.04 °C in 2018.

This viewpoint asks questions about the application of AI and generative algorithms in digitizing urban design practices. It reflects on the possibilities of conjoining urban morphology and design theory into City Information Modelling (CIM) as a new digital tool for urban designers and reveals challenges in the ongoing development of new CIM software. Urban designers work within intricate design worlds with toolboxes that consist of customized design elements and symbologies. The design worlds consist of elements, rules and paterns and they act as holding environments for their unique diagrammatic design knowledge. CIM and AI should understand design worlds with customized toolboxes and provide help to automate repetitive behaviour paterns while designing. © 2020, Built environment.

To formulate a high-quality planning scheme, an accurate estimate of the parking demand is critical. Most previous published studies were based primarily on parking survey data, which is both costly and inaccurate. Owing to limited data sources and simplified models, most of the previous research estimates the parking demand without consideration for the relationship between parking demand, land use, and traffic attributes, thereby causing a lack of accuracy. Thus, this study proposes a big-data-driven framework for parking demand estimation. The framework contains two steps. The first step is the parking zone division method, which is based on the statistical information grid and multidensity clustering algorithms. The second step is parking demand estimation, which is extracted by support vector machines posed in the form of a machine learning regression problem. The framework is evaluated using a case in the city center in Cangzhou, China. © 2020 Yunlin Guan et al.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099291080,Yes,China,Transportation,Urban Mobility,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Big Data Analytics,Estimation,Develop a big-data-driven framework for accurate parking demand estimation in urban central districts,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

However, not all IoT platform service providers provide monitoring features on every device and provide information such as device location, purpose, condition. Therefore, this research aims to develop an IoT Platform that can receive data and provide information on each device, making it easier to process data and control devices.

ITSs generally rely on captured images to evaluate the status of traffic and perform vehicle statistics. However, such images may contain confidential information, and thus, securing such images is paramount. Therefore, we propose in this paper an efficient framework for improving the security of CC-IoT based ITSs. The proposed framework allows extracting particular vehicle information without revealing any sensitive information. Towards this goal, a convolutional neural network is used to classify encrypted images, based on the vehicle type in real-time, obtained by cameras integrated into road-side units that are part of an ITS leaving sensitive information in all images hidden. Within the proposed framework, we develop a new image classification architecture that never fully decrypts the captured images, thus protecting drivers' personal information, such as location, license plate, and vehicle contents. In addition, the system does not require a fully decrypted image, which increases the system computational efficiency as compared to conventional systems. The obtained results show that the proposed partial decryption classification technique presents up to 18% reduction in average computational complexity when compared with a fully decrypted system. © 2020 IEEE.

Smart city projects are being implemented in various parts of the world where analysis of public data helps in providing a better quality of life. Data analytics plays a vital role in many such data-driven applications. Real-time analytics for finding valuable insights at the right time using smart city data is crucial in making appropriate decisions for city administration. It is essential to use multiple data sources as input for the analysis to achieve better and more accurate data-driven solutions. It helps in finding more accurate solutions and making appropriate decisions. Public safety is one of the major concerns in any smart city project in which real-time analytics is much useful in the early detection of valuable data patterns. It is crucial to find early predictions of crime-related incidents and generating emergency alerts for making appropriate decisions to provide security to the people and safety of the city infrastructure. This paper discusses the proposed real-time big data analytics framework with data blending approach using multiple data sources for smart city applications. Analytics using multiple data sources for a specific data-driven solution helps in finding more data patterns, which in turn increases the accuracy of analytics results. The data preprocessing phase is a challenging task in data analytics when data being ingested continuously in real-time into the analytics system. The proposed system helps in the preprocessing of real-time data with data blending of multiple data sources used in the analytics. The proposed framework is beneficial when data from multiple sources are ingested in real-time as input data and is also flexible to use any additional data source of interest. The experimental work carried out with the proposed framework using multiple data sources to find the crime-related insights in real-time helps the public safety solutions in the smart city. The experimental outcome shows that there is a significant increase in the number of identified useful data patterns as the number of data sources increases. A real-time based emergency alert system to help the public safety solution is implemented using a machine learning-based classification algorithm with the proposed framework. The experiment is carried out with different classification algorithms, and the results show that Naive Bayes classification performs better in generating emergency alerts. © 2020 SCPE.","The authors would like to thank Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), Government of India, for their support in a part of the research.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85098757031,Yes,India,Big Data Analytics,Smart Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Big Data Analytics,Data Processing,Develop real-time big data analytics framework with data blending approach for multiple data sources in smart city applications,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

To achieve this objective this study proposes an architecture for recommender systems applied to healthcare which can prioritize emergency cases. The architecture brings an ensemble approach for prediction which adopts multiple Machine Learning algorithms. The methodology used to carry out the study followed three steps.

The urban rail transit is an important part of public transport in large cities with characteristic of intensive passengers and confined space, which is easy to become viral infection intermediary. In order to prevent and control the situation of the epidemic, the police's public security department for urban rail transit and the urban rail transit operation company have established a three-layer filter network, which is composed of safety inspection, patrol and temporary interrogation, and intelligent police service, and this network implements the deep learning technology to identify key persons, prohibited luggage, and the body temperature of passengers. For the problem of uncertainty in total passenger flow and its density, this paper proposes a method for re-establishing the passenger flow model to focus on data monitoring, and resetting the threshold value of alarm to control the passenger density. In view of the difficulty of passenger identification caused by mask during the epidemic, this paper proposes a systematic schema of timely adjusting face recognition algorithm, modifying the alarm threshold, using iris recognition system, carrying out information collision comparison, deep mining and intelligent judging, which discover the high-risk groups of epidemic prevention and control in time.

However, through effective traffic management, it has been found that the level of pollution can be significantly reduced, facilitating the mobility of urban arterials. This study aims to quantify the extent of traffic emissions and to identify the influence of traffic management to improve air quality and reducing traffic emissions. An Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model was developed to estimate the extent of traffic emissions (N0<inf>2</inf> and PM<inf>10</inf>) at certain intersections. Then, a traffic management simulation software was also used to simulate traffic and to build a traffic improvement scenario at these intersections. This was followed by measuring the improvement in air quality due to traffic management modification, analysed using the developed ANFIS model. The results showed that reducing the delay at certain intersections may reduce N0<inf>2</inf> and PM<inf>10</inf> significantly.

The study utilized a modern machine learning computer vision algorithm in the urban build environment to simulate the process, which starts with the visual perception of the urban street landscape and ends with the human reaction to street vitality. By analyzing the optimized trained model, we tried to identify urban street vitality’s visual features and evaluate their importance. A region around the Mochou Lake in Nanjing, China, was set as our study area. Seven investigators surveyed the area, recorded their evaluation score on each site’s vitality level with a corresponding picture taken on site. A total of 370 pictures and recorded score pairs from 231 valid survey sites were used to train a convolutional neural network. After optimization, a deep neural network model with 43 layers, including 11 convolutional ones, was created. Heat maps were then used to identify the features which lead to high vitality score outputs. The spatial distributions of different types of feature entities were also analyzed to help identify the spatial effects. The study found that visual features, including human, construction site, shop front, and roadside/walking pavement, are vital ones that correspond to the vitality of the urban street. The consistency of these critical features with traditional urban vitality features indicates the model had learned useful knowledge from the training process. Applying the trained model in urban planning practices can help to improve the city environment for better attraction of residents’ activities and communications. © 2020 Wuhan University.

However, a series of problems, such as the explosive growth of smart devices and limited spectrum resources, still greatly limit the application of edge computing. Different types of end devices generate and collect multimodal information, and substantial data is transmitted to upper nodes. Multimodal machine learning methods process data at edge nodes, and only high-level features are uploaded to the cloud in order to save bandwidth. In this article, we propose a novel multimodal data processing framework based on multiple attention mechanisms. Two distinct attention mechanisms are used to capture inter and intra-modality dependencies and align different modalities together. We conduct experiments on image captioning, a core research hotspot in multimodal machine learning. A unified hierarchical structure extracts features from images and natural language. Matching attention aligns visual and textual information. Besides, we propose a new attention mechanism, positional attention, which finds the relationship of each element within one sensory modality. The hierarchical structure realizes parallel computation in the training phase and speeds up the training of the model.

The paper considers the issues of neural network application for detection and prediction of road accidents. The overtaking process of cars with crossing into oncoming traffic is analyzed. The potential possibility of road accident reduction while overtaking is shown owing to intellectual assessment of road situation dynamics development. Method. We proposed to use a two-class classifier based on a neural network. Road situations while overtaking with crossing into oncoming traffic were the objects of classification. The data on them was transmitted to the neural network input in the form of the frame set, that is, a graphical representation of discrete states of the “group of vehicles — section of the road” system. Frame formation was expected to be carried out as a result of information exchange between detectors and vehicle-mounted sensors, and road infrastructure, which is developed within the framework of the “smart city” paradigm. Main Results. The road situation is classified as “Dangerous” in case of high vehicle collision probability while overtaking and “Safe”, otherwise. If the situation is considered as “Dangerous”, the vehicle central processor generates an appropriate effect on the vehicle control elements to prevent an accident. Results of situation simulation implemented on Tensor Flow open software library for machine learning are obtained. They showed high prediction accuracy (0.96) on artificial data set. Practical Relevance. The results of the work can be used in promising unmanned and manned vehicles having radio communication with road infrastructure elements within the “smart city” concept to prevent road accidents caused by dangerous overtaking. © 2020, ITMO University.

In recent years, countries around the world have spared no effort in promoting smart cities. Smart homes are an interesting technological advancement that can make people's lives much more convenient. The development of smart homes involves multiple technological aspects, which include big data, mobile networks, cloud computing, Internet of Things, and even artificial intelligence. Digital information is the main component of signal control and flow in a smart home, while information security is another important aspect. In the event of equipment failure, the task of safeguarding the system's information is of the utmost importance. Since smart homes are automatically controlled, the problem of mobile network security must be taken seriously. To address these issues, this paper focuses on information security, big data, mobile networks, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things. Security efficiency can be enhanced by using a Secure Hash Algorithm 256 (SHA-256), which is an authentication mechanism that, with the help of the user, can authenticate each interaction of a given device with a WebServer by using an encrypted username, password, and token. This framework could be used for an automated burglar alarm system, guest attendance monitoring, and light switches, all of which are easily integrated with any smart city base. In this way, IoT solutions can allow real-time monitoring and connection with central systems for automated burglar alarms. The monitoring framework is developed on the strength of the web application to obtain real-time display, storage, and warning functions for local or remote monitoring control. The monitoring system is stable and reliable when applying SHA-256. © 2020 Tran Anh Khoa et al.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097274250,Yes,Vietnam,Smart Buildings,Smart Infrastructure,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,IoT,Optimization,Design efficient smart home management with IoT smart lighting as element of developing smart cities,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy; SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

Seen that the urban data collected through hardware sensors and crowdsourcing has the limitations of uneven information distribution, poor data comprehensiveness and high resource costs, we turn to the Internet resources of real-time updates and extensive information coverage. Therefore, we propose an approach to Sensing Urban text Data from Internet Resources (SUDIR). We put forward innovative work on two key issues: Urban data recognition for Chinese context and urban data sensing for multi-source web resources. On one hand, we design a Chinese urban data recognition model based on Whole Word Masking for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT-WWM) embedding model and Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory with a Conditional Random Field (BLSTM-CRF) sequence labeling model. We introduce Chinese Word Segmentaion (CWS) concept in BERT embedding model to make the text embedding effect better represent semantic information on Chinese context. BLSTM-CRF model based on deep learning is used to achieve high-quality coding and prediction. On the other hand, we propose a method of Extracting Urban text data based on Web page features and Clustering operation (EUWC). EUWC is used to correct the false negative samples labeled by BERT-WWM+BLSTM-CRF recognition model and enable SUDIR to sense more accurate and comprehensive city data from multi-source web resources. The experimental results show that our work outperforms the other baseline methods, and it also proves that SUDIR using Internet resources and deep learning technology has the advantages of low-cost, high-quality urban data sensing. © 2020 IEEE.","This work was supported by the Science and Technology Development Program of Jilin Province, China under Grant 20190303133SF.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097193471,Yes,China,Urban Data Analytics,Urban Governance,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Deep Learning,Information Extraction,Develop SUDIR approach for sensing urban text data from internet resources based on deep learning for smart city construction,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

This means that all these issues must be treated via software, especially using machine learning techniques. In this paper, a methodology is proposed, which is based on: extraction and processing of relevant information from social media; determination of its context; explanation of transportation related phenomena in terms of their contexts; and prediction of traffic conditions. The methodology was applied to a case study using data from the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil. Results shown that it was possible to associate traffic-related and context data to predict the traffic conditions that were originally reported in a Twitter account. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","This work is part of a project funded by the Brazilian agencies MCTI/MC/CGI and São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), grant no. 2015/24423-3.

People can wear a variety of wearable devices to monitor their physiological conditions. The pulse wave is a kind of physiological signal which is widely applied in the physiological monitoring system. However, the pulse wave is susceptible to artifacts, which prevents its popularization. In this work, we propose a novel beat-to-beat artifact detection algorithm, which performs pulse wave segmentation based on wavelet transform and then detects artifacts beat by beat based on the decision list. We verified our method on data acquired from different databases and compared with experts' annotations. The segmentation algorithm achieved an accuracy of 96.13%. When it is applied to detect main peaks, the performance achieved an accuracy of 99.11%. After the previous segmentation algorithm, the artifact detection algorithm can detect beat-to-beat pulse waves and artifacts with an accuracy of 98.11%. The result indicated that the proposed method is robust for pulse waves of different patterns and could effectively detect the artifact without the complex algorithm. In summary, our proposed algorithm is capable of annotating pulse waves of various patterns and determining pulse wave quality. Since our method is developed and evaluated on the transmission-mode PPG data, it is more suitable for the devices and applications inside the hospitals instead of reflectance-mode PPG. © 2020 Qihan Hu et al.","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61071004), Shanghai Science and Technology Support Project (18441900900), Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project (2017SHZDZX01), and Project of Shanghai Engineering Research Center (19DZ2250800).",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096622115,Yes,China,Healthcare,Urban Services,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"AI, Signal Processing",Anomaly Detection,Develop robust beat-to-beat artifact detection algorithm for pulse wave monitoring in smart city healthcare,SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being; SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

The data collected from various sensors, receptors and receivers can be stored in a reliable, cost effective and manageable cloud storage. Predictive analytics such as predictive modelling and machine learning can be used to analyze the latest and past data from the cloud to forecast the near and far future. The predictive analytics will immediately send notifications and the appropriate actions to be taken to the concerned system so that the residents can get equable life. Waste management such as sewage management and trash management are one of the major exertions in a smart city. In this paper, predictive analytics is applied on the cloud data collected from various sensors attached on the waste management resources such as trash bins and sewage pipes. Firstly, group of trash bins and sewage pipes are attached with radio wave sensors which in turn connected to an IoT enabled receiver to provide cost effective data collection. Secondly, the data from the receivers are stored in a cloud. Thirdly, predictive analytics using K-means clustering are proposed for applying on the data in the cloud. Finally, actions like redirecting the trash collection truck and sewage clearing robot based on the priority can be done automatically and long-term actions can be directed to the concerned authorities with notifications and alerts to take necessary actions. In this paper, designing of an immaculate smart city is proposed which can be achieved by developing IoT based trash collection and sewage cleaning system.

To develop an accurate people counting approach, deep learning can be used as it greatly improves the accuracy of machine learning-based approaches. To this end, we have previously proposed an accurate you only look once (YOLO)-based people counting approach, dubbed YOLO-PC. However, the model of YOLO-PC was very large with an excessive number of parameters, thus it requires large storage space on the device and makes transmission on internet a time consuming task. In this paper, a new real-time people counting method named as squeeze YOLO-based people counting (S-YOLO-PC) is proposed. S-YOLO-PC uses the fire layer of SqueezeNet to optimise the network structure, which reduces the number of parameters used in the model without decreasing its accuracy. Based on the obtained the experimental results, S-YOLO-PC reduces the number of model parameters by 11.5% and 9% compared to YOLO and YOLO-PC, respectively. S-YOLO-PC can also detect and count people with 41 frames per second (FPS) with the average precision (AP) of person of 72%. © © The Author(s) 2018. Published by Inderscience Publishers Ltd.

Short-Term electric load forecasting for individual residential customers plays a progressively crucial role in the operation and planning of future grids. Compared to the aggregated electrical load at the community level, the prediction of individual household electric loads is legitimately challenging because of the high uncertainty and volatility involved. Results from previous studies show that prediction using machine learning and deep learning models is far from accurate, and there is still room for improvement. We herein propose a deep learning framework based on a combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-Term memory (LSTM). The proposed hybrid CNN-LSTM model uses CNN layers for feature extraction from the input data with LSTM layers for sequence learning. The performance of our developed framework is comprehensively compared to state-of-The-Art systems currently in use for short-Term individual household electric load forecasting. The proposed model achieved significantly better results compared to other competing techniques. We evaluated our proposed model with the recently explored LSTM-based deep learning model on a publicly available electrical load data of individual household customers from the Smart Grid Smart City (SGSC) project. We obtained an average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 40.38% for individual household electric load forecasts in comparison with the LSTM-based model that obtained an average MAPE of 44.06%. Furthermore, we evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed model on different time horizons (up to 3 h ahead). Compared to the recently developed LSTM-based model tested on the same dataset, we obtained 4.01%, 4.76%, and 5.98% improvement for one, two, and six look-forward time steps, respectively (with 2 lookback time steps). Additionally, we have performed clustering analysis based on the power consumption behavior of the energy users, which indicate that prediction accuracy could be improved by grouping and training the representative model using large amount of data. The results indicated that the proposed model outperforms the LSTM-based model for both 1 h ahead and 3 h ahead in forecasting individual household electric loads. © 2013 IEEE.","The authors extend their appreciation to the Deputyship for Research & Innovation, ‘‘Ministry of Education’’ in Saudi Arabia for funding this research work through the project number IFKSURG-1438-034.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092754843,Yes,Saudi Arabia,Energy and Utilities,Smart Infrastructure,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Hybrid CNN-LSTM,Prediction/Forecasting,Develop hybrid CNN-LSTM model for short-term individual residential household electric load forecasting for smart grids,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy; SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

This evolutionary field is mainly lead by wireless sensor network, radio frequency identification, and smart mobile technologies. Among others, the IoT plays a key role in the form of smart medical devices and wearables, with the ability to collect varied and longitudinal patient-generated health data, and at the same time also offering preliminary diagnosis options. In terms of efforts made for helping the patients using IoT-based solutions, experts exploit capabilities of the machine learning algorithms to provide efficient solutions in hemorrhage diagnosis. To reduce the death rates and propose accurate treatment, this paper presents a smart IoT-based application using machine learning algorithms for the human brain hemorrhage diagnosis. Based on the computerized tomography scan images for intracranial dataset, the support vector machine and feedforward neural network have been applied for the classification purposes. Overall, classification results of 80.67% and 86.7% are calculated for the support vector machine and feedforward neural network, respectively. It is concluded from the resultant analysis that the feedforward neural network outperforms in classifying intracranial images. The output generated from the classification tool gives information about the type of brain hemorrhage that ultimately helps in validating expert's diagnosis and is treated as a learning tool for trainee radiologists to minimize the errors in the available systems. © 2020 Hang Chen et al.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092134464,Yes,China,Healthcare,Urban Services,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"Machine Learning, IoT",Classification,Develop smart machine learning model for brain hemorrhage diagnosis based on IoT in smart cities,SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being; SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

Vehicle velocity measurement is one of the fundamental data collection efforts for motor vehicles. The velocity detection using electronic registration identification of motor vehicles is constrained by the detection algorithm, the material of the automobile windshield,the placement of the decals, the installation method of the signal reader, and the angle of the antenna. The software and hardware for electronic motor vehicle registration identification produced in the standard manner cannot meet the accuracy of velocity detection for all scenarios. Based on the actual application requirements, we propose a calibration method for the numerical output of theautomobile velocity detector based on edge computing of the optimized multiple reader/writer velocity values and based on a particle swarm-optimized radial basis function (RBF) neural network. The proposed method was tested on a two-way eight-lane road, and the test results showed that it can effectively improve the accuracy of velocity detection using electronic registration identification ofmotor vehicles. Compared with the actual velocity, 87.12 of all the data samples had an error lessthan 5, and 91.76 of the data samples for vehicles in the center lane had an error less than 5%. Bycalibrating the electronic vehicle velocity based on the registration identification, the accuracy ofvelocity detection in different application environments can be improved. Moreover, the method can establish an accurate foundation for application in traffic flow management, environmental protection, traffic congestion fee collection, and special vehicle traffic management. © 2020 JingfengYang et al.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092074723,Yes,China,Transportation,Urban Mobility,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"Mobile Edge Computing, CNN",Calibration,Develop numerical calibration method for vehicle velocity data from electronic registration identification based on mobile edge computing and CNN,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Mixed,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

A large variety of algorithms were proposed to improve the prediction accuracy. However, these studies were mainly based on complete data and did not discuss the vulnerability of massive data missing. And applications of these algorithms were in high-cost under the constraints of high quality of traffic data collecting in real-time on the large-scale road networks. This paper aims to deduce the traffic operational conditions of the road network with a small number of critical segments based on taxi GPS data in Xi'an city of China. To identify these critical segments, we assume that the states of floating cars within different road segments are correlative and mutually representative and design a heuristic algorithm utilizing the attention mechanism embedding in the graph neural network (GNN). The results show that the designed model achieves a high accuracy compared to the conventional method using only two critical segments which account for 2.7% in the road networks. The proposed method is cost-efficient which generates the critical segments scheme that reduces the cost of traffic information collection greatly and is more sensible without the demand for extremely high prediction accuracy.

Higher nocturnal air temperature (Tair) is associated with adverse effects on human health, higher mortality rates, and higher energy consumption. Prediction of the spatial distribution of Tair is a step toward the 'Smart City' concept, providing an early warning system for vulnerable populations. The study of the spatial distribution of urban Tair was thus far limited by the low spatial resolution of traditional data sources. Volunteered geographic information provides alternative data with higher spatial density, with citizen weather stations monitoring Tair continuously in hundreds or thousands of locations within a single city. In this article, the aim was to predict the spatial distribution of nocturnal Tair in Berlin, Germany, one day in advance at a 30-m resolution using open-source remote sensing and geodata from Landsat and Urban Atlas, crowdsourced Tair data, and machine learning (ML) methods. Results were tested with a 'leave-one-date-out' training scheme (testingcrowd) and reference Tair data (testingref). Three ML algorithms were compared - Random Forest (RF), Stochastic Gradient Boosting, and Model Averaged Neural Network. The optimal model based on accuracy and computational speed is RF, with an average root mean square error (RMSE) for testingcrowd of 1.16 °C (R2 = 0.512) and RMSE for testingref of 1.97 °C (R2 = 0.581).

Public transport is playing an increasingly important role in urban mobility with a need to move people and goods efficiently around the city. With such pressures on existing public transportation systems, this paper investigates the opportunities to use social media to more effectively engage with citizens and customers using such services. This research forms a case study of the use of passively collected forms of big data in cities–focusing on Sydney, Australia. Firstly, it examines social media data (Tweets) related to public transport performance. Secondly, it joins this to longitudinal big data–delay information continuously broadcast by the network over a year, thus forming hundreds of millions of data artifacts. Topics, tones, and sentiment are modeled using machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. These resulting data, and models, are compared to opinions derived from a citizen survey among users. The validity of such data and models versus the intentions of users, in the context of systems that monitor and improve transport performance, are discussed. As such, key recommendations for developing Smart Cities were formed in an applied research context based on these data and techniques. © 2020 Wuhan University.

In fact, different applications have different features and different requirements on services. In order to satisfy users' Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, the application-awareness technique should be leveraged to distinguish different applications for providing the differentiated services. However, the traditional Internet only can obtain the local network view, which belongs to the offline awareness mode and cannot adapt to the dynamical network environment. At the right time, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has been accepted as a new networking paradigm thanks to its network awareness on the global status information, which can greatly facilitate the online application-awareness. At present, three ways, i.e., port number, depth packet inspection and deep learning can be used for the application-awareness. To the best of our knowledge, the deep learning based application-awareness method is the most cutting-edge technique. In spite of this, the previous related schemes fail to effectively guarantee the correctness and stability. To this end, this paper proposes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based deep learning mechanism to do the application-awareness, including three phases, i.e., traffic collection, data pre-processing and application-awareness. The SDN environment is implemented based on the MiniNet and the simulation experiments are made based on the TensorFlow. The experimental results show that the proposed application-awareness mechanism outperforms three benchmarks on recall ratio, precision ratio, $F$ value and stability. © 2013 IEEE.",This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Project under Grant 2017YBF1300900 and in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61973063.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85091272164,Yes,China,Telecommunications,Smart Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Deep Learning,Classification,Develop novel SDN-based application-awareness mechanism using deep learning for IoT and smart city QoS requirements,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

The huge volume of IoT data generated from these applications require efficient processing to get the insight, which poses significant difficulty. Data mining and machine learning (DM) algorithms are used to minimize such difficulty. However, it is still very challenging to select a particular DM algorithm that can process a dynamic IoT dataset based on some application-specific goals to achieve better accuracy. This paper proposes a knowledge-driven framework that considers the knowledge of datasets, available DM algorithms, and application goals to select the suitable DM algorithm for performing a target data processing task. This work considers data from cultural domain, health domain, and transportation domain in the experiment. The results show that the proposed approach dynamically selects the best-suited DM algorithms for the available datasets and target goals that exhibits satisfactory performance in obtaining accurate results compared to the existing work.

To this end, it is using-among other means-new disruptive technologies that will allow it to dominate data and communications in the political, economic, and social realms across the large expanse of the initiative. The Digital Silk Road has been a part of the PRC's approach since at least 2015, when it first appeared in a government white paper on BRI. The Digital Silk Road binds together new technologies in ""bundles, "" such as smart cities, smart ports, and satellite-networked communications, using 5G as a baseline for other technologies like artificial intelligence, data analytics, and the Internet of Things. Success in using this communications infrastructure to dominate markets, standards, and political elites would give China a multiregional base from which to project its norms, systems, and networks to the wider global market. In the long run, this will not only give a competitive advantage to Chinese companies but also allow them to spread more widely across remaining markets. policy implications • The Digital Silk Road has deep geopolitical implications. Building the backbone of communications infrastructure in BRI countries will allow the PRC to access, analyze, and exploit in real time the large data sets of recipient countries. • Through these technologies and its tech companies, the PRC is exporting its governance model, surveillance system, and financial institutions. • Policy elites in recipient nations could become vulnerable to even greater influence operations as Chinese tech companies administer their networks in real time and collaborate with stage actors like the United Work Front Department. • The PRC could use the centralization of data in smart port systems to create a deniable, surgical sanctions system by interdicting or slowing the container traffic of states or their leaders. © 2020 National Bureau of Asian Research.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85091220805,No,United States,Geopolitics,Policy and Ethics,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Not specified,Analysis,Examine strategic intentions and origins of Digital Silk Road and implications for US and like-minded countries,"SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions",Conceptual/Theoretical,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Three trends are especially important in shaping the impact of domestic policies on the Digital Silk Road. First, recent industrial policies have increasingly focused on technologies centered around artificial intelligence, 5G telecommunications, and smart networks. Second, while policies are still state-led, they rely on close partnerships with private firms such as Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent. Third, a new wave of regional policies aims to create urban clusters that will be more efficient and less congested than regions dominated by single large cities. Each of these trends can be witnessed in the activities of Alibaba in Malaysia. Already a pioneer of smart city development in China, Alibaba has begun implementing its City Brain program in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, complementary to its e-commerce and logistics initiatives in Southeast Asia. While Malaysia is a front runner in these activities, similar dynamics are at work throughout the region. There are powerful complementarities created by dynamic private Chinese businesses, the large Chinese market, and the availability of finance for China-supported infrastructure programs. policy implications • The U.S. and other nations committed to open standards need to recognize that a few Chinese companies, like Alibaba, have already made substantial inroads into Southeast Asia and are purveying an attractive business model. • The U.S. and Japan need to improve the quality of their game in Southeast Asia. It cannot be presumed that a backlash will develop against Chinese government-dominated initiatives or corruption. On the contrary, attractive, concrete, low-cost alternatives must be offered to the countries, businesses, and people of Southeast Asia. • The ultimate shape of smart infrastructure is not yet known, and the potential for heightened transparency and more responsive systems is large. Many countries, and specifically those in Southeast Asia, have an interest in open systems that increase their options and do not tie them to a single business partner. The U.S. needs to develop a comprehensive program to strengthen the open global system and provide these countries with secure access to it. © The National Bureau of Asian Research, Seattle, Washington. © 2020 National Bureau of Asian Research.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85091207771,No,United States,Business and Economics,Policy and Ethics,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Not specified,Analysis,Demonstrate how China's domestic industrial policies support the Digital Silk Road through Alibaba's activities in Malaysia,SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth,Empirical,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Mapping LULC from remotely sensed data based on satellite image classification handle the rapid changes in extensive geographical areas. Several effective and efficient mechanisms suggested for supervised satellite image classification. The neural networks machine learning algorithm became a major method in supervised satellite image classification. The objective of this article is to employ neural networks as a machine learning algorithm for LULC mapping. The study applied in Ankara area, which is the capital city of Turkey. This work utilized a free Landsat 8 satellite image with the Operational Land Imager OLI sensor to implement the analysis. The image was obtained and processed in ArcGIS software. Then, the machine learning data set developed using Python scripting language. Every band out of 8 bands from Landsat 8 image considered as an explanatory variable, while the output variable defined based on visual interpretation. The training dataset built based on the signature file and random sample points. The training dataset divided into three sections, for training, for validation and the last section for testing. The training and testing processes were implemented using Google-Tensor Flow Keres library from Anaconda distribution. Feedforward neural network structure implemented with 500 neurons in the hidden layer. Confusion matrix used as accuracy assessment metrics to measure the performance of the developed model. The overall accuracy of the developed model was 92%. In terms of overall accuracy and robustness, the neural networks algorithm was effectively implemented and the LULC map produces. The model gained high accuracy that it is satisfied with the geospatial accuracy target. The consequence showed the competence of neural networks algorithm to generating LULC maps from Landsat 8 satellite images. © 2020 Baltic Journal of Modern Computing.

Unlike previous network generations, 5G utilizes complex digital technologies such as massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (mMIMO) and runs over higher radio frequencies. The introduction of new technologies and advanced features in the 5G network raises new challenges for network operators, and merging Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the effective solutions to address these complexities. However, AI-enabled 5G network engenders security concerns and requires improvement to meet the standardization and qualification of the new network generation. To mitigate these dilemmas, Blockchain must be integrated. Blockchain, as a decentralized methodology provides a secure sharing of information and resources among various nodes of 5G environments.

With the development of data mining, artificial intelligence technology, and human posture detection, it is much more possible to figure out how behaviors and movements influence people's health and life and how to adjust the relationship between work and rest, which is needed urgently for modern people against this high-speed lifestyle. Using smart technology and daily behaviors to supervise or predict people's health is a key part of a smart city. In a smart city, these applications involve large groups and high-frequency use, so the system must have low energy consumption, a portable system, and a low cost for long-term detection. To meet these requirements, this paper proposes a posture recognition method based on multisensor and using LoRa technology to build a long-term posture detection system. LoRa WAN technology has the advantages of low cost and long transmission distances. Combining the LoRa transmitting module and sensors, this paper designs wearable clothing to make people comfortable in any given posture. Aiming at LoRa's low transmitting frequency and small size of data transmission, this paper proposes a multiprocessing method, including data denoising, data enlarging based on sliding windows, feature extraction, and feature selection using Random Forest, to make 4 values retain the most information about 125 data from 9 axes of sensors. The result shows an accuracy of 99.38% of extracted features and 95.06% of selected features with the training of 3239 groups of datasets. To verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, three testers created 500 groups of datasets and the results showed good performance.

To this extent, replay attacks have been one of the most common threats on smart city infrastructure, which compromises authentication in a smart city network. For example, a replay attack may physically damage smart city infrastructure resulting in loss of sensitive data, incurring considerable financial damages. Therefore, towards securing smart cities from reply attacks, intrusion detection systems and frameworks based on deep learning have been proposed in the recent literature. However, the absence of the time dimension of these proposals is a major limitation. Therefore, we have developed a deep learning-based model for replay attack detection in smart cities. The novelty of the proposed methodology resides in the adoption of deep learning based models as an application for detecting replay attacks to improve detection accuracy. The performance of this model is evaluated by applying it to a real life smart city dataset, where replay attacks were simulated. Our results show that the proposed model is capable of distinguishing between normal and attack behaviours with relatively high accuracy. In addition, according to the results, our proposed model outperforms traditional classification and deep learning models. Last but not least, as an additional contribution, this paper presents a real life smart city data set with simulated replay attacks for future research. © 2013 IEEE.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089703667,Yes,Australia,IoT and Edge Computing,Smart Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Deep Learning,Security/Anomaly Detection,Develop replay attack detection for smart cities using deep learning to protect authentication,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

Analysis of crime data has been a key part yet a considerable challenge for discovering crime patterns and reducing crimes. In recent year, along with the development of data collection and data mining techniques, lots of big data-related studies have been conducted to analyze the crime data. Studying the numerical influential factors is one important yet challenging problem, especially for those indirect features. Though a number of studies have been conducted to analyze the influential factors of crime activities, most of them have some limitations in the era of 'big data'. Some adopted the linear statistical methods, of which the basic assumption is opposite to the non-linear real world. Some limited their studied factors within one or two aspects. Some overlooked the importance of ranking the influence of factors. To fill these research gaps, this paper proposes a big data approach to analyze the influential factors on the crime activities, and experimented it on New York City. More than 1515 different factors ranging from demographic, housing, education, economy, social, and city planning were considered and analyzed. The proposed framework combines non-linear machine learning algorithms and geographical information system (GIS) to study the spatial determinants of crimes. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) is used to select the optimum feature set. Performance of gradient boost decision tree (GBDT), logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) are compared to generate the optimum model. Important impact factors were then investigated using GBDT and GIS. The experimental results demonstrate that the combined GBDT and GIS model can find out the most important factors of crime rate with high efficiency and accuracy. © 2013 IEEE.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089551399,Yes,China,Public Safety and Security,Urban Safety,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"Big Data, Data Mining",Pattern Discovery,Explore hidden influential factors on crime activities using big data approach to discover crime patterns,"SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities; SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

Crowd management stands for the decisions and actions taken to supervise and control densely populated spaces and it involves multiple challenges, from recognition and assessment to application of actions tailored to the current situation. To that end, Wi-Fi-based monitoring systems have emerged as a cost-effective solution for the former one. The key challenge that they impose is the requirement to handle large datasets and provide results in near real-time basis. However, traditional big data and event processing approaches have important shortcomings while dealing with crowd management information. In this paper, we describe a novel system architecture for real-time crowd recognition for smart cities and smart buildings that can be easily replicated. The described system proposes a privacy-aware platform that enables the application of artificial intelligence mechanisms to assess crowds' behavior in buildings employing sensed Wi-Fi traces.

In this paper, we propose the Multi-View Tree Structure (MVTS) learning for 3D model retrieval and recognition. MVTS contains three key consecutive modules. Firstly, the visual feature learning module extracts the visual features of multiple views. Then, we design a score matrix to estimate the value of contextual information between view pairs. Based on the score matrix, a maximum spanning tree is constructed to further explore the contextual information within multiple views. Then, we utilize the bidirectional Tree-LSTM to encode the contextual information among views and the spatial information of tree structure and optimize the tree parameters. After that, the tree attention strategy is adopted to explore the importance of each view. Comparing to existing methods, our proposed method explores the spatial information of 3D model without the requirement of specific camera settings, which is more suitable for real applications. Moreover, our method jointly realizes the feature learning, view-wise contextual information and tree spatial information encoding and view importance estimating, which enhances the discrimination of the 3D model representation.

The prototype allows customers to remotely access and browse the available products at the minimarket using a special smart-phone application. The system can intelligently detect the nearby location of customers and subsequently provide location-dependent services such as allowing orders to be placed using the application, predicting weekly customer expenditures based on artificial-neural-network machine-learning approach, and automatically delivering purchased products using a robotic shopping cart. This proposal is believed to support safe shopping which became a critical issue after COVID-19 pandemic. From a service provider view point, the application allows the provider to remotely manage the minimarket by adding/removing product items, keeping track of shortage in products, and getting revenue information. Empirical results show that the average service time of the minimarket is ≈ 60 seconds per customer. However, an analytical model based on queueing theory was used to analyze the performance of the system when customers arrive according to a Poisson random process and get served according to a general-service-time distribution (M/G/1). The case of batch customer arrivals (M[H] /G/1) was also analyzed, where batch size is also assumed to be random. Various traffic intensities and the effect of variable service times were studied and cross-validated with simulation results.

In fact, though this is an era of digitalization and artificial intelligence, the establishment of an entire smart city platform still requires high costs, especially in poor and developing countries where technological developments are still almost absent.

The method of semantic segmentation has a desirable application prospect. Nowadays, the methods mostly use an encoder-decoder architecture as a way of generating pixel by pixel segmentation prediction. The encoder is for extracting feature maps and decoder for recovering feature map resolution. An improved semantic segmentation method on the basis of the encoder-decoder architecture is proposed. We can get better segmentation accuracy on several hard classes and reduce the computational complexity significantly. This is possible by modifying the backbone and some refining techniques. Finally, after some processing, the framework has achieved good performance in many datasets. In comparison with the traditional architecture, our architecture does not need additional decoding layer and further reuses the encoder weight, thus reducing the complete quantity of parameters needed for processing. In this paper, a modified focal loss function is also put forward, as a replacement for the cross-entropy function to achieve a better treatment of the imbalance problem of the training data. In addition, more context information is added to the decode module as a way of improving the segmentation results. Experiments prove that the presented method can get better segmentation results.

Taking 47 counties and cities in Jilin Province as an example, this paper evaluates the green utilization efficiency of urban construction land (GUEUCL) in 2011 and 2015 by using the unexpected output super-SBM model and explores the spatial-temporal differentiation characteristics and influencing factors of GUEUCL by using GIS and machine learning methods. The results show that (1) the GUEUCL in Jilin Province is low, mainly distributed in small- and medium-sized areas, with significant positive spatial correlation. The L-L concentration area is mainly distributed in the eastern region, but the degree of spatial concentration is small, the spatial structure characteristics of the two periods are different, and the spatial heterogeneity is large; (2) the internal factor decomposition shows the impact of pure technical efficiency on the comprehensive efficiency and the restriction ability is stronger than the scale efficiency, that is to say, the factors such as management and technology have a greater impact on the comprehensive efficiency; (3) the relative importance of external factors has always been ranked as socioeconomic factors, urban development factors, and natural science and technology factors. This paper focuses on the temporal and spatial characteristics of each county and city and the influencing factors, which provides a certain value reference for the pilot of ecological construction and the development of ecoenvironmental benefit economic system in Jilin Province. © 2020 Huisheng Yu et al.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089095779,Yes,China,Land Use,Urban Planning,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Evaluation Model,Evaluation,Evaluate green utilization efficiency of urban construction land resources for sustainable city development in Jilin Province,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Regional,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

In addition, unsupervised machine learning requires a clustering parameter value in advance, and may affect clustering performance according to prior information such as the number and size of clusters. In this case, the fuzzifier value m to be applied is the most important factor in improving the accuracy of data. Therefore, in this paper, we intend to perform clustering to automatically acquire the determination of m_{1} and m_{2} values that depended on existing repeated experiments. To this end, in order to increase efficiency on deriving appropriate fuzzifier value, we used the Interval type-2 possibilistic fuzzy C-means (IT2PFCM), clustering method to classify a given pattern. In Efficient IT2PFCM method, used for clustering, we propose an algorithm that derives suitable fuzzifier values for each data. These values also extract information from each data point through the histogram approach and Gaussian Curve Fitting method. Using the extracted information, two adaptive fuzzifier value m_{1} and m_{2} are determined. Obtained values apply the new lowest and highest membership values. In addition, it is possible to form an appropriate fuzzy area on each cluster by only taking advantage of the characteristics of IT2PFCM, which reduces uncertainty. This doesn't only improve the accuracy of clustering of measured sensor data, but can also be used without additional procedures such as data labeling or the provision of prior information. It is also efficient at monitoring numerous sensors, managing and verifying sensor data collected in real time such as smart cities. Eventually, in this study, the proposed method is to improve IT2PFCM performance on accurate and quick clustering of large amount of complex data such as Internet of Things (IoT). © 2013 IEEE.","This work was supported by the Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) funded by the Korea Government, Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) (Implementation of Verification Platform for ICT Based Environmental Monitoring Sensor) under Grant 2019-0-00136.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088705759,No,South Korea,General AI/ML,Technology,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"Type-2 Fuzzy Set, Unsupervised ML",Clustering,Develop data clustering method using efficient fuzzifier values derivation for handling uncertainties,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure",Empirical,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the physical modeling methods cannot include the nondeterministic factors of the manipulator, such as flexibility, joint clearance, and friction. In this paper, the Semiparametric Deep Learning (SDL) method is proposed to model robot inverse dynamics. SDL is a type of deep learning framework, designed for optimal inference, combining the Rigid Body Dynamics (RBD) model and Nonparametric Deep Learning (NDL) model. The SDL model takes advantage of the global characteristics of classic RBD and the powerful fitting capabilities of the deep learning approach. Moreover, the parametric and nonparametric parts of the SDL model can be optimized at the same time instead of being optimized separately. The proposed method is validated using experiments, performed on a UR5 robotic platform. The results show that the performance of SDL model is better than that of RBD model and NDL model. SDL can always provide relatively accurate joint torque prediction, even when the RBD or NDL model is not accurate. © 2020 Nan Liu et al.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088698013,Yes,China,Robotics,Smart Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Semiparametric Deep Learning,Modeling,Develop semiparametric deep learning method for manipulator inverse dynamics modeling in smart cities and factories,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

The road accidents percentage is growing exponentially and so are the fatalities caused due to accidents. However, the primary cause of the increased rate of fatalities is due to the delay in emergency services. Many lives could be saved with efficient rescue services. The delay happens due to traffic congestion or unstable communication to the medical units. The implementation of automatic road accident detection systems to provide timely aid is crucial. Many solutions have been proposed in the literature for automatic accident detection. The techniques include crash prediction using smartphones, vehicular ad-hoc networks, GPS/GSM based systems, and various machine learning techniques. With such high rates of deaths associated with road accidents, road safety is the most critical sector that demands significant exploration.

They also facilitate new methods of analyzing the built environment, ranging from artificial intelligence (AI) to crowdsourced citizen participation. Digital representations of cities have become so refined that they challenge our perception of the real. However, computers have not yet become able to detect and analyze the visible features of built structures depicted in photographs or other media. Recent scientific advances mean that it is possible for this new field of computer vision to serve as a critical aid to research. Neural networks now meet the challenge of identifying and analyzing building elements, buildings and urban landscapes. The development and refinement of these technologies requires more attention, simultaneously, investigation is needed in regard to the use and meaning of these methods for historical research. For example, the use of AI raises questions about the ways in which computer-based image recognition reproduces biases of contemporary practice. It also invites reflection on how mixed methods, integrating quantitative and qualitative approaches, can be established and used in research in the humanities. Finally, it opens new perspectives on the role of crowdsourcing in both knowledge dissemination and shared research. Attempts to analyze historical big data with the latest methods of deep learning, to involve many people—laymen and experts—in research via crowdsourcing and to deal with partly unknown visual material have provided a better understanding of what is possible. The article presents findings from the ongoing research project ArchiMediaL, which is at the forefront of the analysis of historical mediatizations of the built environment. It demonstrates how the combination of crowdsourcing, historical big data and deep learning simultaneously raises questions and provides solutions in the field of architectural and urban planning history. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088528272,Yes,Netherlands,Cultural Heritage,Urban Planning,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Artificial Intelligence,Object Detection,Apply AI for automated recognition of buildings in image sources for digital excavation of urban heritage,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Past,Cross-sectional,Strong

This study proposed a framework to delineate and analyze mixed land-use patterns and their evolution using municipal water consumption data. A two-step classification strategy was designed based on the rotation forest scheme to differentiate the socioeconomic types of customers (e.g., residence, commerce, public facility, manufacturing, and recreation) using multiple features extracted from the various forms of water consumption time series. The spatial distributions of the socioeconomic functions were then derived, and the mixed land use was measured using a diversity index based on information entropy. Such an approach was applied to Changshu, a typical developing county-level city in China, for the period 2004 to 2013. The results showed that the urbanization of Changshu experienced both spatial expansion and intensification, with a slightly declining rate of growth in recent years. Apart from the city center, two subcenters have emerged for industrial development. The degree of land-use mixture has increased with urban growth, indicating a maturing of urbanization. This study explored the approach of identifying individual socioeconomic functions by the consumption patterns of municipal services and demonstrated that municipal service data sets can reveal land-use patterns and dynamics at a fine spatial resolution to evaluate urban planning and management, with the advantages of large population coverage and long-term temporal lengths. © 2020, © 2020 by American Association of Geographers.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088399245,Yes,China,Land Use,Urban Planning,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Data Analysis,Pattern Discovery,Propose framework for sensing mixed urban land-use patterns using municipal water consumption time series,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Longitudinal,Medium

Ensuring proper level of security, continuity and failure-free operation of such systems, in practice, seems not yet a solved problem. In this article we present proposals of a system allowing to detect different types of anomalies in network traffic for Smart Lighting critical infrastructure realized with the use of Power Line Communication technology. Furthermore, there is proposed and described the structure of the examined Smart Lighting Communications Network along with its particular elements. We discuss key security aspects which affect proper operation of advance communication infrastructure, i.e. possibility of occurrence of abuse connected both to activity of external factors which could disturb transmission of steering signals, as well as active forms of attack aiming at influencing the informative content of the transmitted data. In the article, there is also presented an effective and quick anomaly detection method in the tested network traffic represented by suitable time series. At the initial stage of the method, the process of detection and elimination of potential outlying observations was realized by one-dimensional quartile criterion. Data prepared in this manner was used for learning recurrent neural networks, i.e. Long and Short-Term Memory types, in order to predict values of the analyzed time series. Further, tests were performed on relations between the forecasted network traffic and its real variability in order to detect abnormal behavior which could mean an attempt of an attack or abuse. Due to a possibility of occurrence of significant fluctuations in real network traffic of the tested Smart Lighting infrastructure, we propose a procedure of recurrent learning with the use of neural networks to obtain more accurate forecasting. The results achieved by means of the performed experiments confirmed effectiveness of the presented method and proper choice of the Long Short-Term Memory neural network for forecasting the analyzed time series. © 2020, IICM.

Accordingly, researchers of this paper studied the adoption intention of Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered Chabot by smart city citizens for delivering anytime, anywhere, and automated public transport information services. These services can include finding routes and schedules, buying tickets, registering complaints,or collecting feedback from commuters. The study employed an extended UTAUT model to measure the adoption intention.

The rapid advances in artificial intelligence can empower UAVs with autonomous capabilities allowing them to learn from their surrounding environment and act accordingly without human intervention. In this paper, we propose a spatiotemporal scheduling framework for autonomous UAVs using reinforcement learning. The framework enables UAVs to autonomously determine their schedules to cover the maximum of pre-scheduled events spatially and temporally distributed in a given geographical area and over a pre-determined time horizon. The designed framework has the ability to update the planned schedules in case of unexpected emergency events. The UAVs are trained using the Q-learning (QL) algorithm to find effective scheduling plan. A customized reward function is developed to consider several constraints especially the limited battery capacity of the flying units, the time windows of events, and the delays caused by the UAV navigation between events. Numerical simulations show the behavior of the autonomous UAVs for various scenarios and corroborate the ability of QL to handle complex vehicle routing problems with several constraints. A comparison with an optimal deterministic solution is also provided to validate the performance of the learning-based solution. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

These devices will collect vast amounts of data which needs to be processed in real-time, overwhelming centralized cloud architectures. To address this need, the industry seeks to process data closer to the source, driving a major shift from the cloud to the ‘edge.’ This article critically investigates the privacy implications of edge computing. It outlines the abilities introduced by the edge by drawing on two recently published scenarios, an automated license plate reader and an ethnic facial detection model. Based on these affordances, three key questions arise: what kind of data will be collected, how will this data be processed at the edge, and how will this data be ‘completed’ in the cloud? As a site of intermediation between user and cloud, the edge allows data to be extracted from individuals, acted on in real-time, and then abstracted or sterilized, removing identifying information before being stored in conventional data centers. The article thus argues that edge affordances establish a fundamental new ‘privacy condition’ while sidestepping the safeguards associated with the ‘privacy proper’ of personal data use. Responding effectively to these challenges will mean rethinking person-based approaches to privacy at both regulatory and citizen-led levels. © 2020 by the author.","This research work was supported as part of the wider project ‘Data Centres and the Governance of Labour and Territory,’ an Australian Research Council Discovery Project (DP160103307).",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087135219,Yes,Australia,IoT and Edge Computing,Policy and Ethics,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Edge Computing,Analysis,Analyze edge computing and privacy implications from self-driving cars to smart city sensors,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities",Conceptual/Theoretical,Qualitative,Global,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

The recent redefinition of the digital twin from the digital replica of a physical asset to the replica of a living or nonliving entity has increased its potential. The digital twin not only disrupts industrial processes, but also expands the domain of health and well-being towards fostering smart healthcare services in smart cities. In this paper, we propose an ISO/IEEE 11073 standardized digital twin framework architecture for health and well-being. This framework encompasses the process of data collection from personal health devices, the analysis of this data, and conveying the feedback to the user in a loop cycle. The framework proposes a solution to include not only X73 compliant devices, but also noncompliant health devices, by interfacing them with an X73 wrapper module as we explain in this paper. Besides, we propose a configurable X73 mobile application, designed to work with any X73 compliant device. We designed and implemented the proposed framework, and the X73 mobile app, and conducted an experiment as a proof of concept of the digital twin in the domain of health and well-being in smart cities.

This proposed network's 1.5 million parameters on the ImageNet dataset are one-half of mainstream neural networks, while at 3 million floating point operations per second (FLOPs) it is one third of mainstream neural networks that have obtained the best performance among known lightweight neural networks. The accuracy on the ImageNet data set is 64.5%, on the Garbage Classification dataset it is 82.5%, and on the TrashNet dataset it is 96.10%. Furthermore, we transplanted the model to the hardware platform and assembled an intelligent trash can; we developed a garbage recognition application to facilitate users to directly identify and receive platform information; we built a visualization and decision support platform to help managers monitor traffic in real time. We combined the intelligent trash can, application, visualization and decision-making platform into a system, which is the most complete and effective system among the known research works.

With rapid urbanisation and the growth of motor vehicles, environment is imposed with serious hazards because of heavy traffic congestion, CO<inf>2</inf> emissions and other pollut-ants. Due to traffic congestion, energy consumption by motor vehicles is also increased in a drastic manner. Most of the cities in India, particularly Delhi is the most air pollutant place due to high consumption of petroleum products by motor vehicles. In general, 1 litre of motor fuel will produce 2.3 kg of CO<inf>2</inf> emission. These issues cause adverse health related problems and in turn reduces the socio-economic growth of a country. These aforementioned issues can be overcome by visualising the data using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques which provides a better solution by forecasting fuel consumption in each region and the major petroleum products utilised. The proposed work focuses on fuel forecasting and comparison of petroleum products consumption in regional and state wise of our country. Visualisation of widely used petroleum products, year wise growth of top three regions, top five states and prediction of fuel consumption for next 10 years is done using descriptive analytics and Trend analysis.

IoT technology is fused with 5G and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for use various fields such as the smart city and smart factory. As the demand for IoT technology increases, security threats against IoT infrastructure, applications, and devices have also increased. A variety of studies have been conducted on the detection of IoT malware to avoid the threats posed by malicious code. While existing models may accurately detect malicious IoT code identified through static analysis, detecting the new and variant IoT malware quickly being generated may become challenging. This paper proposes a dynamic analysis for IoT malware detection (DAIMD) to reduce damage to IoT devices by detecting both well-known IoT malware and new and variant IoT malware evolved intelligently. The DAIMD scheme learns IoT malware using the convolution neural network (CNN) model and analyzes IoT malware dynamically in nested cloud environment. DAIMD performs dynamic analysis on IoT malware in a nested cloud environment to extract behaviors related to memory, network, virtual file system, process, and system call.

With the emergence of smart cities, it would be beneficial to leverage the processing power of deep learning to assist in the planning and testing of different policies to address this issue. When examining a population of homeless individuals, one can view them as being distributed, at any one point in time, among several possible states: for example, the street or an emergency shelter. Our work aims to provide a means of simulating across these states, including no longer homeless, over time. The probability that an individual will transition from one state to another is called a transition probability. Thus, by creating a matrix of transition probabilities between all of the states, we have a transition probability matrix. If we simply approached this problem by using a mathematical model such as a Markov decision process, we run into the issue of how to accurately adjust the probabilities to produce realistic results. Ideally, we would have a model that can reasonably modify them based on real-life data. To do this, we introduce two modified deep learning algorithms; modified deep q-learning (MDQL) and modified neural fitted q-iteration (MNFQ). These algorithms dynamically produce a set of transition probability matrices for each week of the year. We discuss the modifications we made to these algorithms to adapt to the homelessness problem and create our simulation. After training our model on high resolution, weekly data, we will show that when running it on a low resolution data set that spans 3 years, our model is able to achieve a relative percent difference from the final population of 12.5%. The end result is a model that can be further improved over time with real world data to provide realistic results. © 2013 IEEE.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085992266,Yes,Canada,Social Policy,Urban Governance,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Modified Deep Q-Learning,Simulation,Simulate evolution of homeless populations in Canada using deep learning for smart city policy planning,SDG 1: No Poverty; SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,National,Future,Longitudinal,Strong

BSS is a system that allows users to rent the bicycle from any automatic rental station. If there're some stations that don't have enough bicycles or free places, then it is usually handled by dedicated vehicles to rebalance the bicycles. Thus, predicting the rental (i.e. the number of renting or returning bicycles) from users in the future is important to improve the service quality. This research uses Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict the rental from users. The RNN consists of three parts: period, closeness, and general. Each of them represents the historical records in different time intervals in the past time respectively. After inputting the historical rental data into RNN and the training process, we can predict the bicycle rental in the coming day by inputting the rental records of the past time into RNN.

In this direction, battery-powered electric bus systems have been considered widely for ensuring flexibility, operation cost, and lesser pollutants emission. Industry 4.0 provides automation through a cyber-physical system (CPS), the interconnection of bus system entities with industrial internet-of-things (IIoT), remote information availability through cloud computing and scientific disciplines (human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, machine learning etc.) integration. In this work, a discrete event-based simulation-optimization approach is integrated that take care of bus energy consumption according to real-time city's passenger needs and on-road friction levels. The proposed simulation optimization methodology utilizes multi-objective with dependent and independent variables for optimizing the overall system performance. In simulation optimization, objective functions are designed to tackle battery consumption, Internet-of-Thing (IoT) network performance, cloud operations efficiency and smart scientific discipline integration. Simulation parameters are based on a real-time bus system which is further analyzed, filtered and adapted as per the needs of the system. In another analysis, supercharger's capacities are varied to evaluate the performance of the proposed system and identify the low cost and efficient smart transportation system. Simulation results show different scenarios for variations in the number of buses, charging stations, bus-depots, mobile charging facilities, and bus-schedules. Simulation results show that the average passenger's waiting time in the waiting is (after ticket booking) varies between 0.2 minutes to 0.7 minutes in real-time traffic conditions. In similar traffic conditions, total passenger's time in system (ticket booking to travel) varies between 41.6 minutes (for 24 hours) to 45.5 minutes (for 1 year). In the simulation, priorities are given to those dependent and independent variables which save the battery consumption and elongate the utilization of buses. Lastly, it is also observed that the proposed system is suitable for resource-constraint devices because Gate Equivalent (GE) calculation shows that the proposed system can be implemented between 1986 GEs (communicational cost without confidentiality and authentication) and 7939 GEs (computational cost with HMAC for authentication in data storage).

Traditional way of using fixed sensors cannot effectively provide a comprehensive view of air pollution in people's immediate surroundings, since the closest sensors can be possibly miles away.

It is a relatively new context-aware healthcare paradigm influenced by several fields of expertise, such as medical informatics, communications and electronics, bioengineering, ethics, to name a few. Smart health is used to improve healthcare by providing many services such as patient monitoring, early diagnosis of disease and so on. The artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and deep learning models, especially the convolutional neural network (CNN), are the most commonly used machine learning approaches where they proved to be performance in most cases. Voice disorders are rapidly spreading especially with the development of medical diagnostic systems, although they are often underestimated. Smart health systems can be an easy and fast support to voice pathology detection. The identification of an algorithm that discriminates between pathological and healthy voices with more accuracy is needed to obtain a smart and precise mobile health system. The main contribution of this paper consists of proposing a multiclass-pathologic voice classification using a novel multileveled textural feature extraction with iterative feature selector. Our approach is a simple and efficient voice-based algorithm in which a multi-center and multi threshold based ternary pattern is used (MCMTTP). A more compact multileveled features are then obtained by sample-based discretization techniques and Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA) is applied to select features iteratively.

Recently, intelligent traffic system (ITS) has emerged as an effective tool to mitigate urban congestion. The key to the ITS lies in the accurate forecast of traffic flow. However, the existing forecast methods of traffic flow cannot adapt to the stochasticity and sheer length of traffic flow time series. To solve the problem, this paper relies on deep learning (DL) to forecast traffic flow through time series analysis. The authors developed a traffic flow forecast model based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The proposed model was compared with two classic forecast models, namely, the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) model, through long-term traffic flow forecast experiments, using an actual traffic flow time series from OpenITS. The experimental results show that the proposed LSTM network outperformed the classic models in prediction accuracy.

Critical issues related to optimization, provision of smart customizable networks and sophisticated computational techniques and methods enabled by artificial intelligence and machine learning need further investigation. The renewable energy (RE) is a powerful resource for the future global development in the context of climate change and resources depletion. Artificial intelligence (AI) implies new rules of organizing the activities in order to respond to these new requirements. It is necessary to improve the design of the energy infrastructure, the deployment and production of RE in order to face the multiple challenges that will affect the sector's growth and resilience..

The framework models the population distribution as a spatiotemporal regression problem using machine learning, and it obtains the binary urban footprint from the population distribution through a binary classifier plus a temporal correction for existing urban regions. The framework estimates the urban footprint in color from its previous value, as well as from past and current values of the binary urban footprint using a semantic inpainting algorithm. By combining this framework with free data from the Landsat archive and the Global Human Settlement Layer framework, interested users can get approximate growth predictions of any city in the world. These predictions can be improved with the inclusion in the framework of additional spatially distributed input variables over time subject to availability. Unlike widely used growth models based on cellular automata, there are two main advantages of using the proposed machine learning-based framework. Firstly, it does not require to define rules a priori because the model learns the dynamics of growth directly from the historical data. Secondly, it is very easy to train new machine learning models using different explanatory input variables to assess their impact. As a proof of concept, we tested the framework in Valledupar and Rionegro, two Latin American cities located in Colombia with different geomorphological characteristics, and found that the model predictions were in close agreement with the ground-truth based on performance metrics, such as the root-mean-square error, zero-mean normalized cross-correlation, Pearson's correlation coefficient for continuous variables, and a few others for discrete variables such as the intersection over union, accuracy, and the f1 metric. In summary, our framework for modeling urban growth is flexible, allows sensitivity analyses, and can help policymakers worldwide to assess different what-if scenarios during the planning cycle of sustainable and resilient cities. © 2019 by the authors.","This document was completed with support from the PEAK Urban programme, supported by UKRI's Global Challenge Research Fund, Grant Ref: ES/P011055/1.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084323568,Yes,Colombia,Urban Planning and Development,Urban Planning,Urban Development & Land Use,Machine Learning,Prediction/Forecasting,Present general framework for modeling urban growth using machine learning for population distribution and urban footprint,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Longitudinal,Medium

However, obtaining the jobs-housing distribution at a fine scale (e.g., the perspective of individual jobs-housing attribute) presents difficulties due to a lack of social media data and useful models. With user data acquired from a location-based service provider in China, this study employs a deep bag-of-features network (BagNet) to classify remote-sensing (RS) images into various jobs-housing types. Considering Wuhan, one of the fastest developing cities in China, as a case study area, three jobs-housing types (i.e., only working, only living, and both working and living) at the land-parcel level are obtained. We demonstrate that the multiscale random sampling method can reduce the influence of image noise, increase the utilization of training data, and reduce network overfitting. By altering the network structure and the training strategy, BagNet achieved excellent fitting accuracy for identifying each jobs-housing type (overall accuracy > 0.84 and kappa > 0.8).

Additionally, we conclude that the total level of mixing within Wuhan is not high at present; however, Wuhan is continuously improving the mixture of jobs and housing.

Given the stochastic and massive nature of big data, the existing literature often relies on artificial intelligence techniques based on information theory. As a new approach, this paper presents a knowledge extraction method based on an analysis of Seoul Metro's 'untraceable' ridership big data. Without identification information, the untraceable ridership data only shows the hourly accumulation of station entry and exit information. To reconstruct the missing information in the data set, this study proposes a fluid dynamics model and adopts a heuristic genetic algorithm based on optimization theory as the problem solver. The result of our model presents the distribution of the elapsed time defined on an hourly basis taken until a passenger returns to the station they departed from. To validate our model, we acquired subway ridership data with passengers' identification with permission from Seoul Metro. This paper presents two novel aspects of subway ridership, namely the dependency on departure time and the discrepancy between weekend and weekday traffic.

In this paper, a novel cross-context tabular document representation approach (Tabdoc) is proposed, where semantic documents used for cross-domain interaction can maintain the same syntax, concepts, and semantic relations. The new method is implemented under Sign Description Framework (SDF) and an editor is newly developed for semantic document creation. Finally, theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation on open datasets demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed scheme. Experimental results indicate that Tabdoc approach can effectively identify, extract and consistently interoperate semantic components of tabular documents. © 2013 IEEE.","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61802079, and in part by the Guangzhou University under Grant RP2020125.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083873187,Yes,China,IoT and Edge Computing,Smart Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"AI, Semantic Web",Data Processing,Develop novel cross-context tabular document representation approach for semantic interoperability in smart cities,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

Access failures in wireless network Base Stations (BSs) produce a phenomenon called 'sleeping cells', which can render a cell catatonic without triggering any alarms or provoking immediate effects on cell performance, making them difficult to discover. To detect this kind of failure, we propose a Machine Learning (ML) framework based on the use of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) statistics from the BS under study, as well as those of the neighboring BSs with propensity to have their performance affected by the failure. A simple way to define neighbors is to use adjacency in Voronoi diagrams. In this paper, we propose a much more realistic approach based on the nature of radio-propagation and the way devices choose the BS to which they send access requests. We gather data from large-scale simulators that use real location data for BSs and IoT devices and pose the detection problem as a supervised binary classification problem. We measure the effects on the detection performance by the size of time aggregations of the data, the level of traffic and the parameters of the neighborhood definition. The Extra Trees and Naive Bayes classifiers achieve Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores of 0.996 and 0.993, respectively, with False Positive Rates (FPRs) under 5%. The proposed framework holds potential for other pattern recognition tasks in smart-city wireless infrastructures, that would enable the monitoring, prediction and improvement of the Quality of Service (QoS) experienced by IoT applications. © 2013 IEEE.",This work was supported by NSERC and Ericsson under Grant CRDPJ 520642.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083437532,Yes,Canada,Telecommunications,Smart Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Machine Learning,Anomaly Detection,Develop machine learning framework for sleeping cell detection in smart-city IoT telecommunications infrastructure,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

Accurate indoor localization plays a vital role in LBS. The ability to localize various subjects in the area of interest facilitates further ubiquitous environments. Specifically, device free localization using wireless signals is getting increased attention as human location is estimated using its impact on the surrounding wireless signals without any active device tagged with subject. In this paper, we propose MuDLoc, the first multi-view discriminant learning approach for device free indoor localization using both amplitude and phase features of Channel State Information (CSI) from multiple Access Points (APs). The same location oriented CSI data can be observed by different APs, thus generating multiple distinct even heterogeneous samples. Multi-view learning is an emerging technique in machine learning which improve performance by utilizing diversity from different view data. In MuDLoc, the localization is modeled as a pattern matching problem, where the target location is predicted based on similarity measure of CSI features of an unknown location with those of the training locations. MuDLoc implements Generalized Inter-view and Intra-view Discriminant Correlation Analysis (GI2DCA), a discriminative feature extraction approach that incorporates inter-view and intra-view class associations while maximizing pairwise correlations across multi-view data sets. Experimental results from two cluttered environments show that MuDLoc can estimate location with high accuracy which outperforms other benchmark approaches. © 2013 IEEE.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083423699,Yes,United States,Indoor Positioning,Smart Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Multi-View Discriminant Learning,Classification,Develop multi-view discriminant learning approach for indoor localization using CSI for smart city LBS,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Weak

Identification and finalization of indicators to be used in the framework for evaluation of Sustainable Smart Cities in Indian context is the objective of the present study. The analyses indicate that Smart Cities Mission guidelines of GOI include 14 performance parameters related with environment, out of which 11 qualify the criteria required for being considered as environmental indicator as per World Bank Environment Development (WBED) considerations and 3 of them do not meet the requirements in terms of clarity of design and quantification for development costs. Further, a set of 20 additional environmental performance indicators are identified from the available literatures on requirements of Sustainable Cities, many of which are generally used as monitoring parameters in various programs of GOI. Subjecting these 20 additional indicators for suitability as environmental indicators based on WBED criteria and City Key Indicators criteria, results in finalizing a set of 13 indicators which meet all requirements and qualify to be used in development of framework for EDSS-SSCI. 10 of these indicators are already part of monitoring programs of Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD), 2 have been suggested by Bureau of Standards (BIS 2016) and 1 considered important by Japan International Corporation Agency (JICA 2016).

Meanwhile, these devices will generate massive amounts of valuable data at the network edge, calling for not only instant data processing but also intelligent data analysis in order to fully unleash the potential of the edge big data. Both the traditional cloud computing and on-device computing cannot sufficiently address this problem due to the high latency and the limited computation capacity, respectively. Fortunately, the emerging edge computing sheds a light on the issue by pushing the data processing from the remote network core to the local network edge, remarkably reducing the latency and improving the efficiency. Besides, the recent breakthroughs in deep learning have greatly facilitated the data processing capacity, enabling a thrilling development of novel applications, such as video surveillance and autonomous driving.

Smart cities can benefit from offloading to edge points in the framework of the so-called cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS), as for example in traffic violation tracking cameras. We assume that there are mobile edge computing networks (MECNs) in more than one region, and they consist of multiple access points, multi-edge servers, and N MDs, where each MD has M independent real-time massive tasks. The MDs can connect to a MECN through the access points or the mobile network. Each task be can processed locally by the MD itself or remotely. There are three offloading options: nearest edge server, adjacent edge server, and remote cloud. We propose a reinforcement-learning-based state-action-reward-state-action (RL-SARSA) algorithm to resolve the resource management problem in the edge server, and make the optimal offloading decision for minimizing system cost, including energy consumption and computing time delay. We call this method OD-SARSA (offloading decision-based SARSA). We compared our proposed method with reinforcement learning based Q learning (RL-QL), and it is concluded that the performance of the former is superior to that of the latter. © 2013 IEEE.",This work was supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University through the Vice Deanship of Scientific Research Chairs.

However, this advancement comes along with new challenges in terms of security of the devices in the IoT networks. Some of these challenges come as network anomalies. Hence, this has prompted the use of network anomaly mitigation schemes as an integral part of the defense mechanisms of IoT networks in order to protect the devices from malicious users. Thus, several schemes have been proposed to mitigate network anomalies. This paper covers a review of different network anomaly mitigation schemes in IoT networks. The schemes' objectives, operational procedures, and strengths are discussed. A comparison table of the reviewed schemes, as well as a taxonomy based on the detection methodology, is provided. In contrast to other surveys that presented qualitative evaluations, our survey provides both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The UNSW-NB15 dataset was used to conduct a performance evaluation of some classification algorithms used for network anomaly mitigation schemes in IoT.

CDR data are a rich geo-referenced source of user behaviour information. In this work, we perform an analysis of CDR data for the city of Milan that originate from Telecom Italia Big Data Challenge. A set of graphs is generated from aggregated CDR data, where each node represents a centroid of an RBS (Radio Base Station) polygon, and each edge represents aggregated telecom traffic between two RBSs. To explore the community structure, we apply a modularity-based algorithm. Community structure between days is highly dynamic, with variations in number, size and spatial distribution. One general rule observed is that communities formed over the urban core of the city are small in size and prone to dynamic change in spatial distribution, while communities formed in the suburban areas are larger in size and more consistent with respect to their spatial distribution. To evaluate the dynamics of change in community structure between days, we introduced different graph based and spatial community properties which contain latent footprint of human dynamics. We created land use profiles for each RBS polygon based on the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service Urban Atlas data set to quantify the correlation and predictivennes of human dynamics properties based on land use. The results reveal a strong correlation between some properties and land use which motivated us to further explore this topic. The proposed methodology has been implemented in the programming language Scala inside the Apache Spark engine to support the most computationally intensive tasks and in Python using the rich portfolio of data analytics and machine learning libraries for the less demanding tasks. c 2020 by the authors.","Funding: This research was funded by The Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia, Grant No. III 44006.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081927828,Yes,Serbia,Land Use,Urban Planning,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,CDR Data Analysis,Pattern Discovery,Uncover relationship between human connectivity dynamics and land use using CDR data,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

Accurate and efficient detection of urban water with remote sensing data is of great significance for urban management and planning. In this article, we proposed a new method by combining Google Earth Engine (GEE) with a multiscale convolutional neural network (MSCNN) to extract urban water from Landsat images, which can be summarized as 'offline training and online prediction' (OTOP). That is, the training of MSCNN is completed offline, and the process of urban water extraction is implemented on GEE with the trained parameters of MSCNN. The OTOP can give full play to the respective advantages of GEE and the convolutional neural network (CNN), and can make the use of deep learning method in GEE more flexible. The proposed method can process the available satellite images with high performance, without data download and storage, and the overall performance of urban water extraction in the test areas is also higher than that of the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) and random forest classifier. The results of the extended validation in the other major cities of China also showed that OTOP is robust and can be used to extract different types of urban water, which benefits from the structural design and training of MSCNN. Therefore, OTOP is especially suitable for the study of large-scale and long-term urban water change detection in the background of urbanization. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Manuscript received November 7, 2019; revised January 18, 2020; accepted January 29, 2020.

Energy management is among the most challenging problems in such metropolitan areas due to the difficulty and key role of energy systems. To optimize the benefit from the available megawatt-hours, it is important to predict the maximum electrical power output of a baseload power plant. This paper explores the method of a deep extreme learning machine to create a predictive model that can predict a combined cycle power plant's hourly full-load electrical output. An intelligent energy management solution can be achieved by properly monitoring and controlling these resources through the internet of things (IoT). The universe of artificial intelligence has produced many strides through deep learning algorithms and these methods were used for data analysis. Nonetheless, for further accuracy, deep extreme learning machine (DELM) is another candidate to be investigated for analyses of the data sequence. By using the DELM approach, a high level of reliability with a minimum error rate is achieved. The approach shows better results compared to previous investigations since previous studies could not meet the findings up to the mark and unable to predict power plant electrical energy output efficiently. During the investigation, it is shown that the proposed approach has the highest accuracy rate of 98.6% with 70% of training (33488 samples), 30% of test and validation (14352 examples). Simulation results validate the prediction effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 2013 IEEE.","This work was supported by the Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081624146,Yes,Pakistan,Energy and Utilities,Smart Infrastructure,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Deep Extreme Learning Machine,Optimization,"Model, simulate and optimize power plant energy sustainability for IoT enabled smart cities using deep extreme learning machine",SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy; SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

The current static spectrum allocation policy does not allow any new entrant to exploit already grid-locked Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum. Hence, quest for larger bandwidth can be fulfilled through other technologies. These include exploiting sub-Terahertz band, Visible Light Communication and Cognitive Radio scheme or exploiting of RF bands in opportunistic fashion. Cognitive Radio is one of those engines to exploit the RF spectrum in secondary style. Cognitive Radio can use artificial intelligence driven algorithms to complete the task. Several intelligent algorithms can be used for better forecasting of spectral holes. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm that can be used to predict the presence of a spectral hole that can be opportunistically exploited for efficient utilization of RF spectrum in secondary fashion. This paper investigates the performance of CNN for metropolitan Karachi city of Pakistan so that the users can be provided with uninterrupted access to the network even under busy hours.

We first exploit a computer vision approach based on scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) to classify the crowd behavior either into panic or normalness. We then consider a number of other parameters from the surroundings namely crowd coherency, social interaction, motion information, randomness in crowd speed, internal chaos level, crowd condition, crowd temporal history, and crowd vibration status along with time stamp. Subsequently, these parameters are fed to deep learning model during training stage and the behavior of the crowd is detected during the testing stage.

The selection of the appropriate analytical methods will allow them to make optimal design and location decisions. Therefore, the research problem of this article is the development of an innovative decision support system using multi-criteria analysis and Geographic Information Systems (decision support system + Geographic Information Systems = DGIS) for planning urban development. The proposed decision support system provides information to energy consumers about the location of energy efficiency improvement potential. This potential has been identified as the possibility of introducing low-energy buildings and the use of renewable energy sources. DGIS was tested in different construction areas (categories: A, B, C, D), Zielona Góra quarters. The results showed which area among the 53 quarters with a separate dominant building category was the most favorable for increasing energy efficiency, and where energy efficiency could be improved by investing in renewable energy sources, taking into account the decision-maker. The proposed DGIS system can be used by local decision-makers, allowing better action to adapt cities to climate change and to protect the environment. This approach is part of new data processing strategies to build the most favorable energy scenarios in urban areas. © 2020 by the authors.","Funding: This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program, Project NO. 2017YFC1500902.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081086550,Yes,Poland,Smart Buildings,Smart Infrastructure,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Decision Support System,Decision Support,Develop innovative decision support system to improve energy efficiency of buildings in urban areas,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy; SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

The aim of the present study is to quantify settlement growth in rural communities in Burkina Faso affected by industrial mining, which often experience substantial in-migration. A multi-annual training dataset was created using historic Google Earth imagery. Support vector machine classifiers were fitted on Landsat scenes to produce annual land use classification maps. Post-classification steps included visual quality assessments, majority voting of scenes of the same year and temporal consistency correction. Overall accuracy in the four studied scenes ranged between 58.5% and 95.1%. Arid conditions and limited availability of Google Earth imagery negatively affected classification accuracy. Humid study sites, where training data could be generated in proximity to the areas of interest, showed the highest classification accuracies. Overall, by relying solely on freely and globally available imagery, the proposed methodology is a promising approach for tracking fast-paced population dynamics in rural areas where population data is scarce. With the growing availability of longitudinal high-resolution imagery, including data from the Sentinel satellites, the potential applications of the methodology presented will further increase in the future. © 2020 by the authors.","Funding: This work is part of the r4d program (www.r4d.ch), which is a joint funding initiative by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [grant number 169461].",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081079403,No,Switzerland,Land Use,Urban Planning,Urban Development & Land Use,Machine Learning,Classification,Quantify settlement growth in rural mining areas in sub-Saharan Africa using machine learning,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The prototype has been designed using Raspberry Pi. Machine learning algorithms has been implanted for data acquisition from various sensor like pH sensor, flame sensor, pressure sensor etc. This study examines SVM implementation in embedded processor architectures and offers improved architectural efficiency. The CAN Protocol is used to collect and relay data from different sensors to the learning algorithm of the computer. TensorFlow software has been embedded to raspberry pi to implement machine learning. CAN is an asynchronous serial communication multi-master, multi-slave protocol mainly used in automobiles for In-vehicle communication. It works on the basis of node message priority instead of address priority, so there is no problem in adding or removing a node in already existing network. CAN provide maximum 1Mbps of data transfer rate, which is more than sufficient to send sensor data from one node to another node. CAN is highly robust and fault tolerant for errors.

In parallel, with the rapid development of advanced technologies, especially deep learning, we urgently need a large-scale SAR dataset supporting urban image interpretation. This article presents OpenSARUrban: a Sentinel-1 dataset dedicated to the content-related interpretation of urban SAR images, including a well-defined hierarchical annotation scheme, data collection, well-established procedures for dataset compilation and organization as well as properties, visualizations, and applications of this dataset. Particularly, our OpenSARUrban collection provides 33 358 image patches of urban SAR scenes, covering 21 major cities of China, including 10 different target area categories, 4 kinds of data formats, 2 kinds of polarization modes, and owning 5 essential properties: large-scale coverage, diversity, specificity, reliability, and sustainability. These properties guarantee the achievement of several goals for OpenSARUrban. The first one is to support urban target characterization. The second one is to help develop well-applicable and advanced algorithms for Sentinel-1 urban target classification. The third one is to explore content-based image retrieval for these kinds of data. In addition, dataset visualization is implemented from the perspective of manifolds to give an intuitive understanding.

To meet the demand of high data-rate, the techniques of multiple antennas and mobile edge computing (MEC) networks have been proposed in order to enhance the data transmission rate significantly. However, there still exist lots of challenges array signal processing assisted MEC networks. In this paper, we propose an intelligent framework of offloading strategy for MEC networks assisted by array signal processing, where one user with multiple antennas has some computational tasks. These tasks can be computed by the user itself which however has limited computational capability, or computed by the near-by computational access points (CAPs) which has a powerful computational capability at the cost of wireless transmission. We consider the system cost by jointly taking into account the computational price, the energy consumption and the latency. By minimizing the system cost, we propose an intelligent offloading strategy based on ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm, where the ants randomly visit the CAPs in order to obtain the final results. To further enhance the MEC network performance, the array signal processing is utilized at the user, where either the maximum ratio transmission (MRT) or selection combining (SC) is used to assist the data transmission from the user to CAPs. Simulation results with MRT and SC are finally demonstrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed ACO-based offloading strategy and array signal processing schemes. © 2013 IEEE.","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61971191, and in part by the Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou under Grant 201807010103.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85080902629,Yes,China,IoT and Edge Computing,Smart Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Intelligent Offloading,Optimization,Design intelligent offloading strategy for relaying mobile edge computing networks to support IoT and smart city,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

Evaluating the liveable environment is a multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem, and the results can be used to control environmental pollution and protect human health. However, different evaluation methods can lead to different results; hence, determining how to effectively to obtain the consistent results is a main consideration of this study. The objective of this work is to design an optimal method based on the difference ratio concept. A hopfield neural network is selected to validate the experimental results. Referring to the liveable city rankings established by the Economist Intelligence Unit, thirteen large cities in China are used to illustrate the application of the model, evaluate the liveable urban environment, and demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed model. The results show that Hangzhou is the most liveable city and Beijing has the worst liveable urban environment.

Yet they fall short when it comes to generating actionable insights for urban design. To support urban interventions, one needs to go beyond predicting beauty, and tackle the challenge of recreating beauty. Unfortunately, deep learning techniques have not been designed with that challenge in mind. Given their 'black-box nature', these models cannot be directly used to explain why a particular urban scene is deemed to be beautiful. To partly fix that, we propose a deep learning framework (which we name FaceLift1) that is able to both beautify existing urban scenes (Google Street Views) and explain which urban elements make those transformed scenes beautiful. To quantitatively evaluate our framework, we cannot resort to any existing metric (as the research problem at hand has never been tackled before) and need to formulate new ones. These new metrics should ideally capture the presence (or absence) of elements that make urban spaces great. Upon a review of the urban planning literature, we identify five main metrics: walkability, green spaces, openness, landmarks and visual complexity. We find that, across all the five metrics, the beautified scenes meet the expectations set by the literature on what great spaces tend to be made of. This result is further confirmed by a 20-participant expert survey in which FaceLift has been found to be effective in promoting citizen participation. All this suggests that, in the future, as our framework's components are further researched and become better and more sophisticated, it is not hard to imagine technologies that will be able to accurately and efficiently support architects and planners in the design of the spaces we intuitively love. © 2020 The Authors.

Recently, faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) and nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) have been regarded as promising technologies to achieve higher SE and massive connections, respectively. In this paper, we aim to exploit the joint benefits of FTN and NOMA by superimposing multiple FTN-based transmission signals on the same physical recourses. Considering the complicated intra- and interuser interferences introduced by the proposed transmission scheme, the conventional detection methods suffer from high computational complexity. To this end, we develop a novel sliding-window detection method by incorporating the state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) technology. The data-driven offline training is first applied to derive a near-optimal receiver for FTN-based NOMA, which is deployed online to achieve high detection accuracy as well as low latency. Monte Carlo simulation results validate that the proposed detector achieves higher detection accuracy than minimum mean squared error-frequency domain equalization (MMSE-FDE) and can even approach the performance of the maximum likelihood-based receiver with greatly reduced computational complexity, which is suitable for IoT applications in smart city with low latency and high reliability requirements. © 2020 Jianxiong Pan et al.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079294993,Yes,China,Telecommunications,Smart Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Deep Learning,Detection,Develop deep learning-aided detection method for FTN-based NOMA for smart city applications and IoT,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

Furthermore, geospatial data management plays a connecting role between data acquisition, data modelling, data visualization, and data analysis. It enables the continuous availability of geospatial data and the replicability of geospatial data analysis. In the first part of this article, five milestones of geospatial data management research are presented that were achieved during the last decade. The first one reflects advancements in BIM/GIS integration at data, process, and application levels. The second milestone presents theoretical progress by introducing topology as a key concept of geospatial data management. In the third milestone, 3D/4D geospatial data management is described as a key concept for city modelling, including subsurface models. Progress in modelling and visualization of massive geospatial features on web platforms is the fourth milestone which includes discrete global grid systems as an alternative geospatial reference framework. The intensive use of geosensor data sources is the fifth milestone which opens the way to parallel data storage platforms supporting data analysis on geosensors. In the second part of this article, five future directions of geospatial data management research are presented that have the potential to become key research fields of geospatial data management in the next decade. Geo-data science will have the task to extract knowledge from unstructured and structured geospatial data and to bridge the gap between modern information technology concepts and the geo-related sciences. Topology is presented as a powerful and general concept to analyze GIS and BIM data structures and spatial relations that will be of great importance in emerging applications such as smart cities and digital twins. Data-streaming libraries and “in-situ” geo-computing on objects executed directly on the sensors will revolutionize geo-information science and bridge geo-computing with geospatial data management. Advanced geospatial data visualization on web platforms will enable the representation of dynamically changing geospatial features or moving objects’ trajectories. Finally, geospatial data management will support big geospatial data analysis, and graph databases are expected to experience a revival on top of parallel and distributed data stores supporting big geospatial data analysis. © 2020 by the authors.","Funding: The support of work for parts of this research funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG FOR 1546-2, BR 2128/18-1, 11-1 et al., and BR 3513/12-1) and the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD 57390945) is gratefully acknowledged.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078872365,Yes,Germany,Urban Data Analytics,Smart Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"Big Data, GIS/BIM Integration",Data Management,Review geospatial data management research progress and future directions for smart city applications,"SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities",Review/Survey,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

However, due to disturbing from environment, the original traffic flow data may be influenced by noise and finally cause the decline of prediction accuracy. This study design a hybrid prediction model combining Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) denoising schemes and classifying learning algorithm based on Fuzzy C-means Neural Network (FCMNN) to improve prediction accuracy. In the model training process, several key parameters in EEMD and FCMNN are determined according to prediction errors based on traffic volume detected from highway network in the Minneapolis city. In the model validation, three widely used indicators for error evaluation are applied to estimate the prediction accuracy of four candidate models under single and multi step, including Artificial Neural Network (ANN), EEMD+ANN, FCMNN and EEMD+FCMNN. The results shown in the case study indicate that the prediction models combined with denoising methods are superior to the models without adopting denoising algorithm. Furthermore, the model using classifying learning method FCMNN can produce higher prediction accuracy than traditional ANN model. In addition, the long-term prediction performance of FCMNN is also much better than that of ANN because that sub-NN system is trained according to each classifying patterns to obtain better optimization effect.

Although earlier works have improved a variety of predictive models of air pollution, the ability to accurately predict air pollution indices remains elusive. Time series prediction plays an important role in many fields. Some predecessors have experimented with artificial neural networks (NNs), combining linear autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models with nonlinear NN models. The typical assumption is that time series has a long signal with no white noise. However, a real-time short signal with white noise is common. The methods in the literature also do not guarantee that the prediction error of an NN model is minimized. Therefore, we propose the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to predict future PM2.5 values. First, we use the Q-learning algorithm in RL based on its state characteristics on the NN model. Second, we select the input with different input dimensions and values of time delay, calculate the best strategy, and evaluate the computational complexity of our RL algorithm.

As demonstrated with an analysis of a small Chinese community in Seoul, South Korea, the proposed approach can reveal the spatiotemporal pattern of linguistic variations effectively and provide insights into the demographic composition as well as social changes in the neighborhood. Although the method presented in this work is at a conceptual stage, it has the potential to open new opportunities to conduct linguistic landscape research at a large scale and in a reproducible manner. It is also capable of yielding a more objective description of a linguistic landscape than arbitrary classification and interpretation of on-site observations. The proposed approach can be a new direction for the study of linguistic landscapes that builds upon urban analytics methodology, and it will help both geographers and sociolinguists explore and understand our society. © 2020 by the author.",Funding: This work was supported by grants from Kyung Hee University in 2016 (KHU-20160553) and from the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2019S1A5A2A03041161).,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078412167,Yes,South Korea,Urban Image Analysis,Social Dynamics,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Image Analysis,Classification,Analyze linguistic landscapes on street-level images to understand relationships between written languages and city sociodemographics,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

Wellbeing solutions within this sector are moving towards identifying how the needs of people in vulnerable situations can be improved or monitored by means of existing supply networks and public institutions. Therefore, the focus of this research is towards wellbeing monitoring solution, through the analysis of gas smart meter data. Gas smart meters replace the traditional analogue electro-mechanical and diaphragm-based meters that required regular reading. They have received widespread popularity over the last 10 years. This is primarily due to the fact that by using this technology, customers are able to adapt their consumption behaviours based on real-time information provided by In-Home Devices. Yet, the granular nature of the datasets generated has also meant that this technology is ideal for further scalable wellbeing monitoring applications. For example, the autonomous detection of households at risk of energy poverty is possible and of growing importance in order to face up to the impacts of fuel poverty, quality of life and wellbeing of low-income housing. However, despite their popularity (smart meters), the analysis of gas smart meter data has been neglected. In this paper, an ensemble model is proposed to achieve autonomous detection, supported by four key measures from gas usage patterns, consisting of i) a tariff detection, ii) a temporally-aware tariff detection, iii) a routine consumption detection and iv) an age-group detection. Using a cloud-based machine learning platform, the proposed approach yielded promising classification results of up to 84.1% Area Under Curve (AUC), when the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was utilised. © 2013 IEEE.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078315242,Yes,United Kingdom,Energy and Utilities,Urban Services,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"Ensemble Detection, Multinomial Classification",Classification,Develop ensemble detection model using smart meter data to improve wellbeing monitoring in smart cities,SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being; SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

City and urban designs might play a role in mitigating the global burden of road transport injury to an extent that has not been captured by traditional safe system approaches. We aimed to determine the relationship between urban design and road trauma across the globe. Methods: Applying a combined convolutional neural network and graph-based approach, 1692 cities capturing one third of the world's population were classified into types based on urban design characteristics represented in sample maps. Associations between identified city types, characteristics contained within sample maps, and the burden of road transport injury as measured by disability adjusted life-years were estimated through univariate and multivariate analyses, controlling for the influence of economic activity. Findings: Between Mar 1, 2017, and Dec 24, 2018, nine global city types based on a final sample of 1632 cities were identified. Burden of road transport injury was an estimated two-times higher (risk ratio 2·05, 95% CI 1·84–2·27) for the poorest performing city type compared with the best performing city type, culminating in an estimated loss of 8·71 (8·08–9·25) million disability-adjusted life-years per year attributable to suboptimal urban design. City types that featured a greater proportion of railed public transport networks combined with dense road networks characterised by smaller blocks showed the lowest rates of road traffic injury. Interpretation: This study highlights the important role that city and urban design plays in mitigating road transport injury burden at a global scale. It is recommended that road and transport safety efforts promote urban design that features characteristics inherent in identified high-performance city types including higher density road infrastructure and high rates of public transit.

Huge advances are being made to develop smart city traffic using big data. Intelligent bus systems based on bus integrated circuit (IC) card systems are constantly developing and improving. Compared with traditional manual survey data, bus IC data is low-cost, real-time and accurate with a simple acquisition method. Bus IC data is an important basic data resource and data mining of bus IC cards can obtain dynamic information about urban bus passenger flow and help improve urban bus planning and service levels. The crucial factor in determining whether this data can be reasonably applied to the optimization of urban bus systems is whether spatial and temporal characteristics of the passenger bus trip can be obtained through bus IC data mining, and there is much current research interest into this topic. In this paper, the characteristics of one-day passenger flow and time-division passenger flow are analyzed based on data obtained from swiping IC cards for one week on a bus in Qingdao. Then, based on a GA-NARX neural network model, the passenger flow is forecast using the IC card swipe data for five working days of Qingdao No. 1 bus (using ten minutes as the time interval). The forecasting results show that the passenger flow can be successfully predicted using this method and thus this method can be used for short-term passenger flow forecasting using bus IC cards. © 2013 IEEE.","This work was supported in part by the Scientific Research Foundation of Hebei Educational Department under Grant ZD2019093, in part by the Fundamental Research Foundation of Hebei Province under Grant 18960106D, in part by the Pacific Northwest Transportation Consortium, in part by the U.S. Department of Transportation University Transportation Center for Federal Region 10, in part by the Science and Technology Planning Project of the Shandong Province under Grant 2016GGB01539, and in part by the Science and Technology Planning Project of the Zibo City under Grant 2019ZBXC515.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078245483,Yes,China,Transportation,Urban Mobility,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,GA-NARX Neural Network,Prediction/Forecasting,Analyze bus trip characteristics and demand forecasting based on GA-NARX neural network for intelligent bus systems,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

The performance and the outcomes of different ML/DL algorithms may vary depending upon the data sets being used, as well as on the suitability of algorithms to the data and the application domain under consideration. Hence, determining which ML/DL algorithm is most suitable for a specific application domain and its related data sets would be a key advantage. To respond to this need, a comparative analysis of well-known ML/DL techniques, including Multilayer Perceptron, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Voting Classifier (or the Ensemble Learning Approach) for the prediction of parking space availability has been conducted. This comparison utilized Santander’s parking data set, initiated while working on the H2020 WISE-IoT project. The data set was used in order to evaluate the considered algorithms and to determine the one offering the best prediction. The results of this analysis show that, regardless of the data set size, the less complex algorithms like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and KNN outperform complex algorithms such as Multilayer Perceptron, in terms of higher prediction accuracy, while providing comparable information for the prediction of parking space availability.

The decentralized database in BT emphasizes data security and privacy. Also, the consensus mechanism in it makes sure that data is secured and legitimate. Still, it raises new security issues such as majority attack and double-spending. To handle the aforementioned issues, data analytics is required on blockchain based secure data. Analytics on these data raises the importance of arisen technology Machine Learning (ML). ML involves the rational amount of data to make precise decisions. Data reliability and its sharing are very crucial in ML to improve the accuracy of results. The combination of these two technologies (ML and BT) can provide highly precise results. In this paper, we present a detailed study on ML adoption for making BT-based smart applications more resilient against attacks. There are various traditional ML techniques, for instance, Support Vector Machines (SVM), clustering, bagging, and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long short-Term memory (LSTM) can be used to analyse the attacks on a blockchain-based network. Further, we include how both the technologies can be applied in several smart applications such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), Smart Grid (SG), healthcare, and smart cities.

The existing neural network structure contains many pooling layers. Although the model incorporated spatial location information when extracting ground object information, many detailed features were also lost. At the same time, due to the great difference between remote sensing image and natural image, the model with good performance of natural image extraction cannot be transplanted directly into the extraction of high-resolution remote sensing image. Based on RefineNET model, this paper proposes an improved HRI-RefineNet (High Resolution Image) model. The model chooses farmland, residential areas, forest, roads and water area as extraction targets, and establishes a new method for extracting land classification information from high resolution remote sensing images. The proposed HRI-RefineNet model adjust the convolution layer number and convolution kernel size respectively according to the texture features of different five kinds of ground objects. An improved pooling layer is designed for the HRI-RefineNet for reducing the loss of location information in feature maps. A decoder group is added to the HRI-RefineNet model. 29 remote sensing images of Tai'an city, China, from 2015 to 2017 were selected for experiment. The experimental results showed that the accuracy of farmland, residential areas, forest, roads and water area obtained by HRI-RefineNET model was 93.9%, 92.3%, 91.7%, 90.1%, 88.7%, respectively, superior to the RefineNET model and some existing advanced models. © 2013 IEEE.","This work was supported in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province under Grant ZR2016FB19, Grant ZR2019MF026, and Grant ZR2017MD018, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 41471299, and in part by the Technology Innovation Fund Project of Shandong Agricultural University under Grant 23659.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077808073,Yes,China,Land Use,Urban Planning,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,HRI-RefineNET Neural Network,Classification,Develop method for extracting land classification information using HRI-RefineNET model to preserve detailed features,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

A smart city integrates the management of multiple internet of things (IoT) terminals to improve urban development and to provide people with a better way of life. As a mobile and flexible terminal form of IoT, sensing fabric has been widely used in smart cities. In this article, a new generation of sensing fabric is combined with the smart city, and an emotion-guided interaction architecture of smart urban living is proposed. However, there is a lot of information redundancy in the spatiotemporal environment that is collected by the various sensing fabrics in a smart city. Therefore, an energy consumption optimization model for sensing fabrics based on the information redundancy in the spatiotemporal environment is also put forward. By recognizing the current data collection ability and residual energy of sensing fabric, an optimal data allocation strategy is obtained to further improve the user experience of the smart urban system. Simulation experiments were carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. © 2013 IEEE.","Funding text 1: The authors, therefore, gratefully acknowledge DSR technical and financial support.; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR), King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, under Grant DF-166-611-1441.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077291749,Yes,China,Smart City Governance,Smart Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"5G, Cloud Computing, AI, IoT",Emotion Recognition,Enable emotion-guided interaction for smart urban living with next generation sensing fabric using AI,SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

Quantification of these changes can be used to balance economic and environmental benefits and most importantly, to support the sustainable urban development. Deep learning has been upgrading the techniques for RS image analysis. However, it requires a large-scale data set for hyper-parameter optimization. To address this issue, the concept of “one view per city” is proposed and it explores the use of one RS image for parameter settings with the purpose of handling the rest images of the same city by the trained model. The proposal of this concept comes from the observation that buildings of a same city in single-source RS images demonstrate similar intensity distributions. To verify the feasibility, a proof-of-concept study is conducted and five fully convolutional networks are evaluated on five cities in the Inria Aerial Image Labeling database. Experimental results suggest that the concept can be explored to decrease the number of images for model training and it enables us to achieve competitive performance in buildings segmentation with decreased time consumption. Based on model optimization and universal image representation, it is full of potential to improve the segmentation performance, to enhance the generalization capacity, and to extend the application of the concept in RS image analysis. © 2019 by the authors.

Re-identification is the problem of matching appearances of objects across different cameras. With the proliferation of surveillance cameras enabling smart and safer cities, there is an ever-increasing need to re-identify vehicles across cameras. Typical challenges arising in smart city scenarios include variations of viewpoints, illumination and self occlusions. Most successful approaches for re-identification involve (deep) learning an embedding space such that the vehicles of same identities are projected closer to one another, compared to the vehicles representing different identities. Popular loss functions for learning an embedding (space) include contrastive or triplet loss. In this paper we provide an extensive evaluation of triplet loss applied to vehicle re-identification and demonstrate that using the recently proposed sampling approaches for mining informative data points outperform most of the existing state-of-the-art approaches for vehicle re-identification. Compared to most existing state-of-the-art approaches, our approach is simpler and more straightforward for training utilizing only identity-level annotations, along with one of the smallest published embedding dimensions for efficient inference. Furthermore in this work we introduce a formal evaluation of a triplet sampling variant (batch sample) into the re-identification literature.

This paper aimed to develop a traffic noise prediction model for mountainous cities. In China, the traffic noise prediction model HJ 2.4-2009, which itself is based on the sound pressure level corrected for roadway gradients (RGs), has been receiving widespread acceptance. On the basis of the model in HJ 2.4-2009, the RG correction coefficient was proposed to modify the original model and a per-vehicle noise prediction model was built using a multilayer feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) model. The data collected from a municipal road of a hilly city, Chongqing, was used to train and validate the ANN model. The predictor variables comprised the per-vehicle noise value, vehicle type, vehicle velocity, and roadway gradient. The results showed that the modified HJ 2.4-2009 model incorporating the gradient correction coefficient achieved a significantly higher R2 for mountainous cities than the original model. Besides, the ANN-based noise prediction model achieved considerable accuracy improvement over the empirical predictive equations. © 2019",The work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 51608084 ]; and the Chongqing Jiaotong University Postgraduate Innovation Project [grant number [ 2018B0101 ].,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076508082,Yes,China,Environmental Monitoring,Environmental Quality,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Artificial Neural Network,Prediction/Forecasting,Develop traffic noise prediction model for mountainous cities using artificial neural networks and gradient correction,SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being; SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

In this study, a novel UAC algorithm exploiting the deep CNNs based feature transfer learning and the deep belief net (DBN) based classification is developed. The spectrogram is first adopted for the urban acoustic stream representation. Then, three deep CNNs pre-trained on ImageNet database are applied as feature extractors. The extracted features are concatenated and fed to a DBN for classifier learning. To achieve a good generalization performance, three restricted boltzmann machines (RBM) trained by the contrastive divergence algorithm (CD) followed by a back-propagation (BP) based fine parameter tuning is adopted in DBN. The proposed UAC is evaluated on a real acoustic database, including 11 categories of acoustic signals recorded from the urban environment.

Different models have been achieved relying on mathematics, cellular automation, complexity, and scaling. While most of these models tend to be a simplification of reality, today within the paradigm shifts of artificial intelligence across the different fields of science, the applications of computer vision show promising potential in understanding the realistic dynamics of cities. While cities are complex by nature, computer vision shows progress in tackling a variety of complex physical and non-physical visual tasks. In this article, we review the tasks and algorithms of computer vision and their applications in understanding cities. We attempt to subdivide computer vision algorithms into tasks, and cities into layers to show evidence of where computer vision is intensively applied and where further research is needed. We focus on highlighting the potential role of computer vision in understanding urban systems related to the built environment, natural environment, human interaction, transportation, and infrastructure.

Assessment of population exposed to environmental noise is limited by a lack of routine noise sampling and is critical for controlling exposure and mitigating adverse health effects. Land use regression (LUR) model is newly applied in estimating environmental exposures to noise. Machine-learning approaches offer opportunities to improve the noise estimations from LUR model. In this study, we employed random forests (RF) model to estimate environmental noise levels in five Canadian cities and compared noise estimations between RF and LUR models. A total of 729 measurements and 33 built environment-related variables were used to estimate spatial variation in environmental noise at the global (multi-city) and local (individual city) scales. Leave one out cross-validation suggested that noise estimates derived from the RF global model explained a greater proportion of variation (R2: RF = 0.58, LUR = 0.47) with lower root mean squared errors (RF = 4.44 dB(A), LUR = 4.99 dB(A)). The cross-validation also indicated the RF models had better general performance than the LUR models at the city scale. By applying the global models to estimate noise levels at the postal code level, we found noise levels were higher in Montreal and Longueuil than in other major Canadian cities. We demonstrated that the random forests models performed better than land use regression models for estimating spatial variation in noise levels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",This work was supported by the Canadian Urban Environmental Health Research Consortium grant funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.

While most previous studies focused on two-dimensional urban development, the spatial characteristics of building heights are rarely explored. Such information could provide valuable implications for smart urban planning and management. However, previous attempts did not systematically investigate the spatial factors that influence building heights and their associations with urban development. Therefore, this study developed a machine learning-based method to compare the distributions of building heights in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, two cities with different development patterns. First, we collected detailed information on the buildings, such as the location and land values. Second, the height of each building was simulated based on the above information using the well-known random forests, k-nearest neighbor algorithm, and artificial neural network. The random forests algorithm outperformed the other two in both cities. We also found that the commercial land value is the most important factor associated with building heights. Moreover, the building heights in Guangzhou are more sensitive to the distances to administrative centers, while the distances to transportation networks exert stronger influences on the building heights in Shenzhen. Overall, these findings could support urban planning and management. More importantly, the proposed method can be used to predict the heights of new buildings and investigate the distributions of building heights in other regions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41801307 and No. 41531176 ).

Earthquake represents one of the most critical disasters. Earthquake-induced built environment modifications (i.e. building debris) affect the urban paths network availability. Historic centres are relevant scenarios because of their specific features (i.e. Heritage vulnerability; complex and compact fabric). Predicting which paths could be used by rescuers to rapidly reach damaged inhabitants could reduce losses and improve first aid actions. Sustainable semeiotic tools are proposed to quickly esteem the paths availability combining street geometrical features and building damages. Currently, no study provides insights on methods reliability. Hence, this work critically analyses methods outcomes by implementing them, for the first time, on the same real-world sample (Italian historic centres). Rapid tools (satellite images, photographic documentation) are used to compare methods previsions with effective post-earthquake paths availability. Pros and cons of each analysed method are evidenced, underlining that the approach that combines street-building geometry, building vulnerability and earthquake severity seems to give the best results.

The concept of smart city has supported a higher quality of urban spaces and a better offering of public services. Smart grid is an important component and the energy supply of smart city. The health of the smart grid will directly affect the health of the smart city. Efficient and accurate prediction about icing level of transmission lines provides a reliable basis for anti-icing and deicing of power grids. The prediction can not only significantly enhance the reliability, safety and stability of transmission networks, but also timely provide the state monitoring of ice on wires to the workers to make proper decisions and to prevent freezing disasters so as to effectively protect people's safety and build a stable and friendly society. To reduce catastrophic damages caused by the iced transmission lines of the grid, this paper proposed a novel hybrid model called PR-KELM, an integration of Principal Component Analysis, ReliefF and Kernel based ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) method to predict the icing level of transmission lines. This hybrid model covered two stages including: 1) structured and unstructured data feature extraction by local binary patterns, principal component analysis and ReliefF; 2) radial basis function Kernel based ELM predicting the processed data. The experimental data adopted in this paper were from the online monitoring system of South China State Grid Online Monitoring System by terminal CC0289 between December 1, 2011 and March 1, 2016. Experimental results indicated: compared with Elman neural network model, random forest model, support vector machine model and Bayesian networks model, PR-KELM approach demonstrated high accuracy and lower prediction error in terms of RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error), and R (Coefficient of Correlation) while applied to predicting in real datasets. © 2019","Funding text 1: This study was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. U1711266 , No. 61440018 and No. 61501411 ), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFC1404700 ).

The large scale deployment of pedelecs, however, requires a careful design of maintenance system to replace the batteries regularly that can be costly. This paper investigates the maintenance of a city-wide pedelec system by developing an offline solution in two steps. First, we develop an optimal and efficient hybrid prediction model which predicts the usage demand of pedelecs in every 48 h on a scale of millions of pedelecs. Our proposal predicts the future usage increment of pedelecs by combining a local predictor, a global predictor, and an inflection predictor, which captures both the short-term and long-term factors affecting the pedelec usage. Second, based on the developed predictor and results of big data analytics, an optimal path planning scheme for the replenishment of pedelec batteries is developed. As compared to other schemes, our scheme can save 40\% of the maintenance cost. To verify our proposal, extensive real-data driven simulations are performed which show that the accuracy of the prediction process is high enough than each traditional method and our proposal solves the maintenance problem efficiently. © 2013 IEEE.","This work is supported by China Scholarship Council (No.201708050093), JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP16K00117 and the KDDI Foundation.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062424685,Yes,Japan,Transportation,Urban Mobility,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,"Big Data, Machine Learning",Prediction/Forecasting,Design battery maintenance system for pedelec sharing using big data based usage prediction and replenishment scheduling,SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy; SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong
