Unfortunately, already threatened by climate change, the cloud forests in our study area are being further endangered during the Covid pandemic. These forests in northern Ecuador are being razed by city dwellers building country homes to escape the Covid virus, as well as by illegal miners desperate for money. Between August 2019 and July 2021, our study area of 52 square kilometers lost 1.17% of its tree cover. We base this estimate on simulations from the predictive model we built using Artificial Intelligence, satellite images, and cloud technology. When simulating tree cover, this model achieved an accuracy between 96 and 100 percent. To train the model, we developed a visual and interactive application to rapidly annotate satellite image pixels with land use and land cover classes. We codified our algorithms in an R package—loRax—that researchers, environmental organizations, and governmental agencies can readily deploy to monitor forest loss all over the world. © © 2021 Pascual and Pascual.",Microsoft’s AI for Earth program provided free access to their Azure cloud platform.

Sensor network resiliency becomes vital for critical networks such as emergency response and waste water treatment. One approach is to engineer ""self-aware""sensors that can proactively change their component composition in response to changes in work load when critical devices fail. By extension, these devices could anticipate their own termination, such as battery depletion, and offload current tasks onto connected devices. These neighboring devices can then reconfigure themselves to process these tasks, thus avoiding catastrophic network failure. In this article, we compare and contrast two types of self-aware sensors. One set uses Q-learning to develop a policy that guides device reaction to various environmental stimuli, whereas the others use a set of shallow neural networks to select an appropriate reaction. The novelty lies in the use of field programmable gate arrays embedded on the sensors that take into account internal system state, configuration, and learned state-action pairs, which guide device decisions to meet system demands. Experiments show that even relatively simple reward functions develop both Q-learning policies and shallow neural networks that yield positive device behaviors in dynamic environments. © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",The authors acknowledge the financial support by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany in the KI-Sprung LUTNet project (project number 16ES1125).,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85145769695,Yes,Germany,Infrastructure,Smart City Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"Q-Learning, Neural Network",Reinforcement Learning,Develop self-aware sensors for smart city networks using Q-learning and neural networks on embedded devices,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

A huge number of similar non-road objects, such as building areas and water areas have interfered with the road area recognition process simultaneously. The above two factors have increased the difficulty of road extraction from remote sensing images. Supervised learning-based road extraction algorithms such as support vector machines and traditional artificial neural networks have to artificially design features so as to train classification models. The recognition rate of these traditional methods has been significantly decreased when facing with the interference of the similar non-road targets and the rich information of the background in the images. Recently, a variety of deep learning techniques of convolutional neural networks have been widely used in the field of remote sensing image processing based on its efficient feature learning ability. Deep learning network has made a great progress in road extraction. It can not only obtain the overall network structure of the road, but also the clear boundaries of the road. A U-Net road segmentation network has been proposed improve the road extraction quality based on the context information and attention mechanism. Method A novel deep neural network for road extraction from remote sensing images has been proposed based on the symmetrical structure of U-Net network and attention mechanism. In the network structure, the introduction of the pre-trained Resnet-34 network can effectively extract image features at different granularities. Resnet-34 residual network has been used as the backbone network of the novel U-Net network. Residual learning can greatly reduce the training time of the deep network, avoid the phenomenon of gradient disappearance, and improve the training accuracy. Meanwhile, the context information has contained the interaction information between different objects, the interaction information between the object and the scene, which can be used as features to combine the various parts between the roads and distinguish the road and the background. The context information extraction module can integrate the context information to ensure that the geometric topology of the road is extracted in the image. To adjust the feature weights, the attention mechanism module can be transmitted by the skip connection, strengthened by the feature information of the road area, suppressed by the feature information of the non-road area improved by the segmentation effect of the road edge thereby effectively improving the accuracy of road segmentation. The improved model has resolved the incomplete and disconnected road structure to a certain extent by adding the context information extraction module. Furthermore, the decoder combined attention mechanism has been used to adjust the feature weights of skip connections to improve the segmentation effect of the road edge area. Combining attention mechanism and context information extraction module can effectively use global and local remote sensing image information to improve the road extraction performance. Result The model on the Deep Globe 2018 road extraction challenge dataset has been tested to evaluate the performance of the proposed model quantitatively. The Deep Global satellite road extraction dataset has contained 6 226 pairs of RGB satellite remote sensing images and labeled with dimension of 1 024 × 1 024 pixels. The dataset has been divided into 5 500 training set and 726 test set in the experiments. In order to evaluate the performance of the road segmentation model, two semantic segmentation performance indices have been commonly used in remote sensing image road segmentation: recall rate (recall) and intersection over union (IOU). The comprehensive experiments have shown that the recall rate and intersection over union of the proposed algorithm for the Deep Globe 2018 road extraction challenge dataset reached 0.847 2 and 0.691 5, respectively. The proposed model can segment a continuous road network. At the same time, the missing location information has been effectively restored to make the edges of the road clearer. The proposed algorithm can improve the use of remote sensing image information by adding context information module and attention mechanism. Compared with U-Net, context encoder network(CE-Net) and other models, it has higher accuracy and robustness. Conclusion: A road extraction model for remote sensing images combined context information and attention mechanism has been proposed. The novel model has benefited from its pre-trained Resnet-34 backbone network and utilization of context information. Utilization of context information has solved incomplete and disconnected road structure to a certain extent. The decoder of the attention mechanism has improved the segmentation effect of the road edge area. The experimental results have demonstrated that the network achieved good results of road extraction from remote sensing images. The proposed method has improved the road segmentation accuracy and displayed the potential in remote sensing image processing. © 2021, Editorial Office of Journal of Image and Graphics.

This is due to continuous usage of fossil fuel energy resources generating air pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides (NO<inf>x</inf>), sulfur dioxide (SO<inf>2</inf>), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O<inf>3</inf>) and particulate matter (PM<inf>10</inf> and PM<inf>2.5</inf>), which impact on climate and air quality and adversely affect the human health. The present paper aims at training an ensemble of forecasting methodologies for traffic-induced pollutant emissions and implementing it for predicting PM<inf>10</inf>, PM<inf>2.5</inf> and NO<inf>2</inf> for the case study of Cambridge, UK inner-city region. Such an ensemble enables decision makers to evaluate the impact of various transportation policies and measures on human health and the ecosystem, and subsequently contribute towards urban resilience and sustainability. Since the chemical synthesis of air pollution is triggered by meteorological factors, the forecasting incorporates them along with the traffic volumes. We opted to combine Statistical and Computational Intelligence learning methods including Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks and Extreme Learning Machines (ELM). Initially, Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equation (MICE) and trend and seasonality removal was performed at data preprocessing and then Principal Component Analysis (PCA) highlighted the principal parameters for ANFIS to predict next day's PM<inf>10</inf>, PM<inf>2.5</inf> and NO<inf>2</inf> values. LSTM and ELM methods estimated next day values and compared with the ANFIS model results for hourly time series data of length 2703. The performance of the embedded models was quantified by the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), and Coefficient of Determination (R2) indices.

The estimation takes into account appliances, electrical heating, cooling, lighting, cooking and EC by m2 on a building level. The results are spatialized on different territorial scales. Using cadastral data of more than 1,700,000 Walloon buildings and annual EC data from a sample collected in 2012 from the energy reports, the paper assesses the EC of the whole building stock and tests to what extent different types of variables (building factors and socio-demographics) explain annual EC. It then shows which individual variables have the highest explanatory power. In contrast to many other studies, the research recognizes the problem of multicollinearity between predictors in regression analysis and uses Lasso regression to address this issue. Three separate regression models were used to study the predictors of annual EC of residential, tertiary and industrial buildings. EC building factors (appliances, auxiliary and main heating, domestic hot water and cooking) explained the largest share which is 66.46% of the variability in EC for residential buildings whereas the EC usages share for tertiary buildings (lighting, heating and domestic hot water, air conditioning, cooling, etc.) is about 50.53% and 38.55% for industrial buildings. Socio-demographic variables on their own explained about 61.59%, 26.34% and 3.41% of the annual EC, respectively for residential, tertiary and industrial buildings. Hence, the building variables present the highest explanatory power for EC, presumably because heating and cooling EC are included in this study. The study highlights that when attempting to explain EC related to Walloon households, including heating and cooling EC, appliances usage has the strongest predictive power in residential buildings. On the other hand, the projected decrease in EC use for heating in existing residential buildings is −8.82% and −10% for existing tertiary buildings while the projected increase in EC use for cooling in existing tertiary buildings is + 11.94% from 2012 to 2050 on a regional scale. These trends follow the predicted regional heating degree-days (HDD) of −11.76% and cooling degree-days (CDD) of 14.04% for the same period based on the gated recurrent unit (GRU) an implemented deep learning (DL) model. In addition, the produced EC maps on different territorial scales show that the highest EC is seen in large and main cities in general. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Walloon Region of Belgium, which financed the Wal-e-cities projects.

This study models the spatial variation in the concentration and distribution of some macronutrients, micronutrients, and trace nutrients in the soil of a high-altitude city in the Andes. Meanwhile, machine learning methods were employed to study some interactions between the different dimensions that constitute an urban socio-ecosystem that caused these variations. We proposed a methodology that considered two phases: a) field work to collect data on 300 soil samples; laboratory analysis to measure the concentrations of 24 macronutrients, micronutrients, and trace nutrients; and the design of geophysical, spectral, and urban co-variables; b) statistical and geo-informatics analysis, where multivariate analysis grouped the elements into factors; and, machine learning integrated with co-variables was applied to derive the intensity of each factor across the city. Multivariate statistics described the variation in soil co-concentrations with a moderate percentage (42%). Four factors were determined that grouped some of the analyzed elements, as follows: F1 (Zn, S, Cu, Pb, Ni, and Cr), F2 (Ba, Ag, K, In, and Mg), F3 (B, V, Li, and Sr), and F4 (Si and Mn). The percentage R2 out-of-bag of the spatial model were: F1 = 20%, F2 = 8%, F3 = 14%, and F4 = 10%.

At present, there are two methods to calculate urban perception. 1) Using a model to learn image features directly automatically; 2) Coupling machine learning and feature extraction based on expert knowledge (e.g. object proportion) method. With two typical streets in Wuhan as the study area, video data were recorded and used as the model input. In this study, two representative methods are selected: 1) End to end convolution neural network (CNN-based model); 2) Based on full convolution neural network and random forest (FCN + RF-based model). By comparing the accuracy of two models, we analyze the adaptability of the model in different urban scenes. We also analyze the relationship between CNN-based model and urban function based on POI data and OSM data, and verify its interpretability. The results show that the CNN-based model is more accurate than FCN + RF-based model. Because the CNN-based model considers the topological characteristics of the ground objects, its perception results have a stronger nonlinear correlation with urban functions. In addition, we also find that the CNN-based model is more suitable for scenes with weak spatial heterogeneity (such as small and medium-sized urban environments), while the FCN + RF-based model is applicable to scenes with strong spatial heterogeneity (such as the downtown areas of China’s megacities). The results of this study can be used as a reference to provide decision support for urban perception model selection in urban planning. © 2021, The Author(s).","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2019YFB2102903), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41801306 and 41671408) and the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province (Grant No. 2017CFA041).",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85150941406,Yes,China,Urban Design,Urban Planning & Land Use,Urban Development & Land Use,CNN,Classification,Compare two deep learning models for urban perception analysis using street video data,SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities),Methodological,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

The objective of this HLA is to serve as a reference framework for the development of industrial Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSANs) based on the concept of the DEWI Bubble. The DEWI Bubble constitutes a set of architecture design rules and recommendations that can be used to integrate legacy industrial sensor networks with a modern, interoperable and flexible IoT (Internet-of-Things) infrastructure. The DEWI Bubble can be regarded as a high-level abstraction of an industrial WSAN with enhanced interoperability (via standardized interfaces), dependability, technology reusability and cross-domain development. The DEWI Bubble aims to resolve the issue on how to integrate commercial WSAN technology to match the dependability, interoperability and high criticality needs of industrial domains. This paper details the criteria used to design the HLA and the organization of the infrastructure internal and external to the DEWI Bubble. The description includes the different perspectives, models, or views of the architecture: the entity model, the layered perspective of the entity model and the functional model. This includes an overview of software and hardware interfaces. The DEWI HLA constitutes an extension of the ISO/IEC 29182 SNRA (Sensor Network Reference Architecture) towards the support of wireless industrial applications in different domains: aeronautics, automotive, railway and building. To improve interoperability with existing approaches, the DEWI HLA also reuses some features from other standardized technologies and architectures. The DEWI HLA and the concept of Bubble allow networks with different industrial sensor technologies to exchange information between them or with external clients via standard interfaces, thus providing consolidated access to sensor information of different industrial domains. This is an important aspect for smart city applications, Big Data, Industry 4.0 and the Internet-of-Things (IoT). The paper includes a non-exhaustive review of the state of the art of the different interfaces, protocols and standards of this architecture.

Future urbanization might be directed along several development typologies, e.g. sprawling urbanization, more compact cities, greener cities, or a combination of different typologies. These developments induce urban land-use change that will affect urban climate and might reinforce phenomena such as the urban heat island and thermal discomfort of urban residents. A planning-based mitigation approach to ensure thermal comfort of residents are urban cold-air paths, i.e. low-roughness areas enabling drainage and transport of colder air masses from rural surroundings. We study how urban land-use change scenarios influence cold-air path occurrence probability and spatial distribution in a mid-European city using a machine learning approach, i.e. boosted regression trees. The Urban Sprawl Scenario results in the strongest reduction of cold-air path area by 3.6% in comparison to the reference case. The Green City Scenario gives evidence for an increase of cold-air path area (2.2%) whereas the Compact Green City Scenario partly counteracts the negative influence of urban densification by increased fractions of vegetated areas. The proposed method allows for the identification of priority areas for cold-air path preservation in urban planning. © 2021, The Author(s).","Funding text 1: We thank the Lower Saxony Niedersächsisches Vorab for funding the project “ metapolis – an inter- and transdisciplinary research platform for the sustainable development of urban-rural relations’, funded by the Federal State of Lower Saxony” (Grant No. ZN3121) in which this study was conducted.; Funding text 2: The study was funded by MWK Lower Saxony Niedersächsisches Vorab as part of the collaborative project “ metapolis – an inter- and transdisciplinary research platform for the sustainable development of urban-rural relations’, funded by the Federal State of Lower Saxony” (Grant No. ZN3121).",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85146047676,Yes,Germany,Urban Climate,Environment & Sustainability,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Not Specified,Simulation,Analyze influence of urban land-use change on cold-air path occurrence for thermal comfort planning,"SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 13 (Climate)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

This research illuminates the public view of the Internet of Things through a content-based and network analysis of contemporary conversations occurring on the Twitter platform. Tweets can be analyzed with machine learning methods to converge the volume and variety of conversations into predictive and descriptive models. We have reviewed 684,503 tweets collected in a 2-week period. Using supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods, we have identified trends within the realm of IoT and their interconnecting relationships between the most mentioned industries. We have identified characteristics of language sentiment which can help to predict the popularity of IoT conversation topics. We found the healthcare industry as the leading use case industry for IoT implementations. This is not surprising as the current COVID-19 pandemic is driving significant social media discussions. There was an alarming dearth of conversations towards cybersecurity. Recent breaches and ransomware events denote that organizations should spend more time communicating about risks and mitigations.

With the development of artificial intelligence, an increasing number of deep-learning algorithms have been applied to traffic estimation and the prediction of urban road networks. However, deep learning cannot describe the evolution mechanism of a traffic flow, which leads to poor interpretability, and the application of analytical transportation models is often limited owing to low prediction accuracy. In this study, the link-transmission model (LTM) was improved, and a data-driven link-transmission model (D2LTM) was proposed. D2LTM uses real-time data to calibrate the simulation network, which improves the prediction accuracy. Accordingly, a spatio-temporal deep tensor neural network (ST-DTNN) was introduced to capture the time-, space-, and depth-dimension feature information in the network-wide traffic data to form a hybrid model, D2LTM-STDTNN, which is a short-term traffic-prediction model for urban road networks. The hybrid model utilized the D2LTM model to reveal the fundamental laws of traffic evolution and could finely describe the temporal and spatial evolution of the urban road network-wide traffic state, which enhanced its interpretability. Furthermore, it employed the ST-DTNN model's capabilities to mine high-dimensional data and dynamic features, improving the accuracy of short-term traffic prediction. The hybrid model also considered the short-term prediction of different turns at intersections, which have finer spatial and temporal granularities and greater prediction difficulties. The actual measurement results show that the D2LTM-STDTNN hybrid model has a higher prediction accuracy than the benchmark model and has the advantage of simulating the evolution mechanism. The model improves the short-term traffic-prediction ability of urban road networks and reveals the dynamic evolution rules of traffic flow between road sections. This model can facilitate network-wide traffic simulation and help realize active transportation management and control. © 2021, Editorial Department of China Journal of Highway and Transport.

Based on the GPS trajectory data of shared E-Bike in Furong district, Changsha City, the accurate identification of reverse riding behavior is realized. The machine learning model CatBoost and interpretable machine learning framework SHAP are used to extract and analyze the influencing factors of reverse riding behavior from the aspects of road conditions, traffic conditions, land use attributes, etc. The results show that: ① CatBoost model can effectively predict the reverse riding frequency of road sections and extract the important influencing factors of reverse riding behavior, mainly including travel time, public transport facilities, land use attributes, road conditions and traffic conditions. ② In terms of travel time, reverse riding is more likely to occur on weekdays and morning & evening peak hours; In terms of public transport facilities and land use attributes, the number of bus stops and subway station exits, and the number of restaurants, companies, shopping and other facilities around the roads present a non-linear influence relationship to the reverse riding frequency. In a certain range, the number of facilities has a positive effect on the reverse riding behavior. In terms of road conditions, reverse riding is less likely to happen with road crossing intervals of 50~400 m. But reverse riding is more likely to happen when there are no physical separation facilities in the bicycle lane or with road crossing intervals of 400~600 m. And the effect is unstable when the intervals is wider than 600 m. In terms of bicycle lane, the reverse riding probability with guardrail separation is lower, while the probability with green belt separation is higher. In terms of traffic conditions, when the riding speed and acceleration are too low or too high, it is negatively related to the reverse riding behavior. When the riding speed is between 6~16 km•h-1 and the acceleration is between 0.3~1.0 m•s-2, it is positively related to the reverse riding behavior. This research can provide an effective technical support for the identification of shared E-Bike risk riding behavior, as well as for the management of non-motor vehicle traffic safety. © 2021, Editorial Department of China Journal of Highway and Transport.

Proper scheduling of numerous energy devices to meet the need of users is a demand of the smart city. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is an emerging methodology that can yield successful control behavior for time-variant dynamic systems. This article proposes an efficient DRL-based energy scheduling approach that can effectively distribute the energy devices based on consumption and users' demand. First, a deep neural network classifies the energy devices currently available in a framework. The DRL then efficiently schedules the devices.

Most current network trustworthiness solutions are insufficient, particularly for critical infrastructures where end devices are vulnerable and easily hacked. In terms of the energy sector, blockchain technology transforms all currencies into digital modes, thereby allowing one person to manage and exchange energy with others. This has drawn the attention of experts in many fields as a safe, low-cost platform to track billions of transactions in a distributed energy economy. Security and trust issues are still relatively new in the current centralized energy management scheme. With blockchain technology, a decentralized energy infrastructure enables parties to establish micro-grid trading energy transactions and apply artificial intelligence (AI). Using AI in energy systems enables machines to learn various parameters, such as predicted required amounts, excess amounts, and trusted partners. In this article, we envision a cooperative and distributed framework based on cutting-edge computing, communication, and intelligence capabilities such as AI and blockchain in the energy sector to enable secure energy trading, remote monitoring, and trustworthiness.

There are few travel services that can quantify low-carbon travel, with a lack of effective low-carbon travel tools to guide transportation behavior. On-demand access to taxi services can effectively reduce the additional carbon emissions caused by cruising, which in turn increases efficiency in urban mobility with a reduced taxi fleet scale. For individual taxis, they lack macroscopic horizon in their choice of passenger pickup paths. The selected travel path based on personal operational experience or real-time location is limited by local optimization when making path decisions. In this work, we proposed a macro-path recommendation method to assist the taxi pickup path selection to accelerate the transformation of the taxi system towards low-carbon sharing. First, an adaptive learning spatiotemporal neural network was used to predict the coarse-grained distribution of potential trips. Next, the trajectory sharing graph was constructed based on the potential trips distribution to reallocate the taxi orders for the continuous pickup path optimization. As a result, the continuous pickup path balanced the relation between travel demands and taxi supply, improving the economic and environmental benefits of taxi operation and contributing to the goal of carbon neutrality. We conducted experiments on the Chengdu city ride-hailing dataset. Compared with the current status of taxi operations, the solution shows improvements in both the scale of taxi services and order gain. © 2021 by the authors.

A transferable built-up area extraction (TBUAE) algorithm was developed to map the built-up area maps. The algorithm allows the developed deep learning model used on a certain satellite image to be eligible for other types of satellite images by altering the data distribution with adaptive Wallis filtering (DT-AWF).

Integrating traffic data, together with their situational context, offers more comprehensive views on the ongoing mobility changes and supports enhanced management decisions accordingly. Hence, cities are becoming sensorized and heterogeneous sources of urban data are being consolidated with the aim of monitoring multimodal traffic patterns, encompassing all major transport modes—road, railway, inland waterway—, and active transport modes such as walking and cycling. The research reported in this paper aims at bridging the existing literature gap on the integrative analysis of multimodal traffic data and its situational urban context. The reported work is anchored on the major findings and contributions from the research and innovation project Integrative Learning from Urban Data and Situational Context for City Mobility Optimization (ILU), a multi-disciplinary project on the field of artificial intelligence applied to urban mobility, joining the Lisbon city Council, public carriers, and national research institutes. The manuscript is focused on the context-aware analysis of multimodal traffic data with a focus on public transportation, offering four major contributions. First, it provides a structured view on the scientific and technical challenges and opportunities for data-centric multimodal mobility decisions. Second, rooted on existing literature and empirical evidence, we outline principles for the context-aware discovery of multimodal patterns from heterogeneous sources of urban data. Third, Lisbon is introduced as a case study to show how these principles can be enacted in practice, together with some essential findings.

Among air pollutants, Particulate Matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 μm (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) is a serious health problem. It causes various illnesses such as respiratory tract and cardiovascular diseases. Hence, it is necessary to accurately predict the PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations in order to prevent the citizens from the dangerous impact of air pollution beforehand. The variation of PM<inf>2.5</inf> depends on a variety of factors, such as meteorology and the concentration of other pollutants in urban areas. In this paper, we implemented a deep learning solution to predict the hourly forecast of PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentration in Beijing, China, based on CNN-LSTM, with a spatial-temporal feature by combining historical data of pollutants, meteorological data, and PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentration in the adjacent stations. We examined the difference in performances among Deep learning algorithms such as LSTM, Bi-LSTM, GRU, Bi-GRU, CNN, and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model. Experimental results indicate that our method “hybrid CNN-LSTM multivariate” enables more accurate predictions than all the listed traditional models and performs better in predictive performance. © 2021, The Author(s).",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121478645,Yes,Morocco,Environment,Environment & Sustainability,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,"Deep Learning (LSTM, CNN)",Prediction/Forecasting,Predict PM2.5 air pollution in smart cities using deep learning approaches,"SDG 3 (Health), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 13 (Climate)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Longitudinal,Strong

Both the number of devices involved and their heterogeneity make the allocation of software com-ponents quite challenging. Despite the enormous flexibility enabled by component-based software engineering, finding the optimal allocation of software artifacts to the pool of available devices and computation units could bring many benefits, such as improved quality of service (QoS), reduced energy consumption, reduction of costs, and many others. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a model-based framework that aims to solve the software component allocation problem (CAP). We formulate it as an optimization problem with either single or multiple objective functions and cover both cases in the proposed framework. Additionally, our framework also provides visualization and comparison of the optimal solutions in the case of multi-objective component allocation. The main contributions introduced in this paper are: (1) a novel methodology for tackling CAP-alike problems based on the usage of model-driven engineering (MDE) for both problem definition and solution representation; (2) a set of Python tools that enable the workflow starting from the CAP model interpretation, after that the generation of optimal allocations and, finally, result visualization. The proposed framework is compared to other similar works using either linear optimization, genetic algorithm (GA), and ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm within the experiments based on notable papers on this topic, covering various usage scenarios—from Cloud and Fog computing infrastructure management to embedded systems, robotics, and telecommunications. According to the achieved results, our framework performs much faster than GA and ACO-based solutions. Apart from various benefits of adopting a multi-objective approach in many cases, it also shows significant speedup compared to frameworks leveraging single-objective linear optimization, especially in the case of larger problem models. © 2021 by the authors.

Throughout this study, a neural network based on home energy management system (NNHEMS) has been developed to set optimal consumer priorities considering many factors, such as load priority, load profiles, environmental aspects, and user comfort. This NNHEMS; has been applied to a grid-connected photovoltaic system with a storage battery to power a house. Based on the available energy of the PV system and the loads type and priority (critical and not-critical loads), the authors design an advanced control system incorporating artificial neural network (ANN) concepts in order to satisfy the energy needs of home users and increase the performance of electricity networks. In this approach, the type of the ANN is the multi-level feedback network (MLFN); interconnection is provided by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm; in which data and computations flow in a specific direction from input to output. The efficiency of the proposed NNHEMS; is demonstrated in an installed house in Bouismail (Algeria) during a summer week (July 2019) with favorable weather conditions. Results demonstrate that the developed NNHEMS could achieve an optimal energy management in this solar house by saving 24.6% of energy consumption. Consequently, demand and supply of renewable energy are to be improved along with electricity network efficiency increase. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121440736,Yes,Algeria,Energy,Smart Grid & Energy,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Neural Network,Optimization,Develop neural network-based home energy management system for smart houses,"SDG 7 (Energy), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

New technology-based solutions must be developed towards attending this growth and ensuring that it is socially sustainable. This paper puts forward the notion that these solutions must share some properties: they should be anthropocentric, holistic, horizontal, multi-dimensional, multi-modal, and predictive. We propose an architecture in which streaming data sources that characterize the city context are used to feed a real-time graph of the city’s assets and states, as well as to train predictive models that hint into near future states of the city. This allows human decision-makers and automated services to take decisions, both for the present and for the future. To achieve this, multiple data sources about a city were gradually connected to a message broker, that enables increasingly rich decision-support. Results show that it is possible to predict future states of a city, in aspects such as traffic, air pollution, and other ambient variables. The key innovative aspect of this work is that, as opposed to the majority of existing approaches which focus on a real-time view of the city, we also provide insights into the near-future state of the city, thus allowing city services to plan ahead and adapt accordingly. The main goal is to optimize decision-making by anticipating future states of the city and make decisions accordingly. © 2021 by the authors.

The Smart City is the revolutionary paradigm aiming at integrating the ICT with the citizen life; among several urban services, transports are one of the most important in modern cities, introducing several challenges to the Smart City paradigm. In order to satisfy the stringent requirements of new vehicular applications and services, Edge Computing (EC) is one of the most promising technologies when integrated into the Vehicular Networks (VNs). EC-enabled VNs can facilitate new latency-critical and data-intensive applications and services. However, ground-based EC platforms (i.e., Road Side Units—RSUs, 5G Base Stations—5G BS) can only serve a reduced number of Vehicular Users (VUs), due to short coverage ranges and resource shortage. In the recent past, several new aerial platforms with integrated EC facilities have been deployed for achieving global connectivity. Such air-based EC platforms can complement the ground-based EC facilities for creating a futuristic VN able to deploy several new applications and services. The goal of this work is to explore the possibility of creating a novel joint air-ground EC platform within a VN architecture for helping VUs with new intelligent applications and services. By exploiting most modern technologies, with particular attention towards network softwarization, vehicular edge computing, and machine learning, we propose here three possible layered air-ground EC-enabled VN scenarios. For each of the discussed scenarios, a list of the possible challenges is considered, as well possible solutions allowing to overcome all or some of the considered challenges. A proper comparison is also done, through the use of tables, where all the proposed scenarios, and the proposed solutions, are discussed. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, we apply a multivariate analysis method (PCA) and four machine learning algorithms to investigate and map the variability and vulnerability of urban floods in the city of Tangier, northern Morocco. Thirteen parameters that could potentially affect urban flooding were selected and divided into two categories: geo-environmental parameters and socio-economic parameters. PCA processing allowed identifying and classifying six principal components (PCs), totaling 73% of the initial information. The scores of the parameters on the PCs and the spatial distribution of the PCs allow to highlight the interconnection between the topographic properties and urban characteristics (population density and building density) as the main source of variability of flooding, followed by the relationship between the drainage (drainage density and distance to channels) and urban properties. All four machine learning algorithms show excellent performance in predicting urban flood vulnerability (ROC curve > 0.9). The Classifications and Regression Tree and Support Vector Machine models show the best prediction performance (ACC = 91.6%). Urban flood vulnerability maps highlight, on the one hand, low lands with a high drainage density and recent buildings, and on the other, higher, steep-sloping areas with old buildings and a high population density, as areas of high to very-high vulnerability. © 2021 by the authors.

Given the scope of many existing studies, it is still unclear how very-high-resolution EO data can help to improve our understanding of the multidimensionality of deprivation within settlements on a city-wide scale. In this work, we assumed that multiple facets of deprivation are reflected by varying morphological structures within deprived urban areas and can be captured by EO information. We set out by staying on the scale of an entire city, while zooming into each of the deprived areas to investigate deprivation through land cover (LC) variations. To test the generalizability of our workflow, we assembled multiple WorldView-3 datasets (multispectral and shortwave infrared) with varying numbers of bands and image features, allowing us to explore computational efficiency, complexity, and scalability while keeping the model architecture consistent. Our workflow was implemented in the city of Nairobi, Kenya, where more than sixty percent of the city population lives in deprived areas. Our results indicate that detailed LC information that characterizes deprivation can be mapped with an accuracy of over seventy percent by only using RGB-based image features. Including the near-infrared (NIR) band appears to bring significant improvements in the accuracy of all classes. Equally important, we were able to categorize deprived areas into varying profiles manifested through LC variability using a gridded mapping approach. The types of deprivation profiles varied significantly both within and between deprived areas. The results could be informative for practical interventions such as land-use planning policies for urban upgrading programs. © 2021 by the authors.

Important challenges arise for machine learning algorithms in this scenario, such as reducing energy consumption and minimizing data exchange between devices in different zones. This paper introduces a novel method for accelerated training of parallel Support Vector Machines (pSVMs), based on ensembles, tailored to these kinds of problems. To achieve this, the training set is split into several Voronoi regions. These regions are small enough to permit faster parallel training of SVMs, reducing computational payload. Results from experiments comparing the proposed method with a single SVM and a standard ensemble of SVMs demonstrate that this approach can provide comparable performance while limiting the number of regions required to solve classification tasks. These advantages facilitate the development of energy-efficient policies in WSN. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper proposes an effective method to improve road extraction accuracy and reconstruct the broken road lines caused by ground occlusion. Firstly, an attention mecha-nism-based convolution neural network is established to enhance feature extraction capability. By highlighting key areas and restraining interference features, the road extraction accuracy is im-proved. Secondly, for the common broken road problem in the extraction results, a heuristic method based on connected domain analysis is proposed to reconstruct the road. An experiment is carried out on a benchmark dataset to prove the effectiveness of this method, and the result is compared with that of several famous deep learning models including FCN8s, SegNet, U-Net and D-Linknet. The comparison shows that this model increases the IOU value and the F1 score by 3.35%-12.8% and 2.41-9.8, respectively.

Flood risk mapping is a key tool in flood management. However, it is computationally expensive to produce flood risk maps using hydrodynamic models. To this end, this paper investigates the use of machine learning for the assessment of surface water flood risks in urban areas. The factors that are considered in machine learning models include coordinates, elevation, slope gradient, imperviousness, land use, land cover, soil type, substrate, distance to river, distance to road, and normalized difference vegetation index. The machine learning models are tested using the case study of Exeter, UK. The performance of machine learning algorithms, including naïve Bayes, perceptron, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), is compared based on a spectrum of indicators, e.g., accuracy, F-beta score, and receiver operating characteristic curve. The results obtained from the case study show that the flood risk maps can be accurately generated by the machine learning models. The performance of models on the 30-year flood event is better than 100-year and 1000-year flood events. The CNNs and ANNs outperform the other machine learning algorithms tested. This study shows that machine learning can help provide rapid flood mapping, and contribute to urban flood risk assessment and management. © 2021 by the authors.

There is a great increase in the crime rate, and the handling officers are responsible for dealing with a broad range of cyber and Internet issues during investigation. IoT technologies are helpful in the identification of suspects, and few technologies are available that use IoT and deep learning together for face sketch synthesis. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other constructs of deep learning have become major tools in recent approaches. A new-found architecture of the neural network is anticipated in this work. It is called Spiral-Net, which is a modified version of U-Net fto perform face sketch synthesis (the phase is known as the compiler network C here). Spiral-Net performs in combination with a pre-trained Vgg-19 network called the feature extractor F. It first identifies the top n matches from viewed sketches to a given photo. F is again used to formulate a feature map based on the cosine distance of a candidate sketch formed by C from the top n matches. A customized CNN configuration (called the discriminator D) then computes loss functions based on differences between the candidate sketch and the feature. Values of these loss functions alternately update C and F. The ensemble of these nets is trained and tested on selected datasets, including CUFS, CUFSF, and a part of the IIT photo–sketch dataset. Results of this modified U-Net are acquired by the legacy NLDA (1998) scheme of face recognition and its newer version, OpenBR (2013), which demonstrate an improvement of 5% compared with the current state of the art in its relevant domain. © 2021 by the authors.

In smart grids (SGs), quality of service (QoS) and AMI traffic management need to be considered in the design of efficient AMI architectures. In this article, we propose a QoS-aware machine-learning-based framework for AMI applications in smart grids. Our proposed framework comprises a three-tier hierarchical architecture for AMI applications, a machine-learning-based hierarchical clustering approach, and a priority-based scheduling technique to ensure QoS in AMI applications in smart grids. We introduce a three-tier hierarchical architecture for AMI applications in smart grids to take advantage of IoT communication technologies and the cloud infrastructure. In this architecture, smart meters are deployed over a georeferenced area where the control center has remote access over the Internet to these network devices. More specifically, these devices can be digitally controlled and monitored using simple web interfaces such as REST APIs. We modify the existing K-means algorithm to construct a hierarchical clustering topology that employs Wi-SUN technology for bi-directional communication between smart meters and data concentrators. Further, we develop a queuing model in which different priorities are assigned to each item of the critical and normal AMI traffic based on its latency and packet size. The critical AMI traffic is scheduled first using priority-based scheduling while the normal traffic is scheduled with a first-in–first-out scheduling scheme to ensure the QoS requirements of both traffic classes in the smart grid network. The numerical results demonstrate that the target coverage and connectivity requirements of all smart meters are fulfilled with the least number of data concentrators in the design. Additionally, the numerical results show that the architectural cost is reduced, and the bottleneck problem of the data concentrator is eliminated. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed framework is evaluated and validated on the CloudSim simulator. The simulation results of our proposed framework show efficient performance in terms of CPU utilization compared to a traditional framework that uses single-hop communication from smart meters to data concentrators with a first-in–first-out scheduling scheme. © 2021 by the authors.

The Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is part of several smart city applications where it enhances the processes of transportation and commutation. ITS aims to solve traffic problems, mainly traffic congestion. In recent years, new models and frameworks for predicting traffic flow have been rapidly developed to enhance the performance of traffic flow prediction, alongside the implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods such as machine learning (ML). To better understand how ML implementations can enhance traffic flow prediction, it is important to inclusively know the current research that has been conducted. The objective of this paper is to present a comprehensive and systematic review of the literature involving 39 articles published from 2016 onwards and extracted from four main databases: Scopus, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink and Taylor & Francis. The extracted information includes the gaps, approaches, evaluation methods, variables, datasets and results of each reviewed study based on the methodology and algorithms used for the purpose of predicting traffic flow. Based on our findings, the common and frequent machine learning techniques that have been applied for traffic flow prediction are Convolutional Neural Network and Long-Short Term Memory. The performance of their proposed techniques was compared with existing baseline models to determine their effectiveness. This paper is limited to certain literature pertaining to common databases. Through this limitation, the discussion is more focused on (and limited to) the techniques found on the list of reviewed articles. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the application of ML and DL techniques for improving traffic flow prediction, contributing to the betterment of ITS in smart cities. For future endeavours, experimental studies that apply the most used techniques in the articles reviewed in this study (such as CNN, LSTM or a combination of both techniques) can be accomplished to enhance traffic flow prediction. The results can be compared with baseline studies to determine the accuracy of these techniques. © 2021, The Author(s).","This research is fully supported by National Defence University of Malaysia (UPNM) and the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia (MOHE) under FRGS/1/2021/ICT07/UPNM/02/1.

Due to the expansion of transportation systems, congestion can lead to spike road accident. Every year thousands of people have died due to traffic accidents. Various technologies have been adopted by modern cities to minimize traffic accidents. Therefore, to ensure people's safety, the concept of the smart city has been introduced. In a smart city, factors like road, light, and weather conditions are important to consider to predict traffic mishap. Several machine learning models have been implemented in the existing literature to determine and predict traffic collision. But the accuracy is not enough and there exist a lot of challenges in determining the accident. In this paper, an approach of particle swarm optimization with artificial neural network (PSO-ANN) has been proposed to determine traffic collision using the dataset of the transport department of United Kingdom. The performance of PSO-ANN outperforms the existing machine learning model. PSO-ANN model can be adopted in the transportation system to counter traffic accident issues.

In particular, models that can obtain long-term land use data with high precision are of great value in research on global environmental change and climate impact, as land use data are important model input parameters for evaluating the effect of human activity on nature. However, the accuracy of existing reconstruction and prediction models is inadequate. In this context, this study proposes an integrated convolutional neural network (CNN) LUCC reconstruction and prediction model (CLRPM), which meets the demand for fine-scale LUCC reconstruction and prediction. This model applies the deep learning method, which far exceeds the performance of traditional machine learning methods, and uses CNN to extract spatial features and provide greater proximity information. Taking Baicheng city in Northeast China as an example, we verify that CLRPM achieved high-precision annual LUCC reconstruction and prediction, with an overall accuracy rate 9.38% higher than that of the existing models. Additionally, the error rate was reduced by 49.5%. Moreover, this model can perform multilevel LUCC classification category reconstructions and predictions. This study casts light on LUCC models within the high-precision and fine-grained LUCC categories, which will aid LUCC analyses and help decision-makers better understand complex land-use systems and develop better land management strategies. © 2021 by the authors.

In the past, the classical approach used for building detection was by using the imagery and it entailed human–computer interaction, which was a daunting proposition. To tackle this task, a novel network based on an end-to-end deep learning framework is proposed to detect and classify buildings features. The proposed CNN has three parallel stream channels: the first is the high-resolution aerial imagery, while the second stream is the digital surface model (DSM). The third was fixed on extracting deep features using the fusion of channel one and channel two, respectively. Furthermore, the channel has eight group convolution blocks of 2D convolution with three max-pooling layers. The proposed model’s efficiency and dependability were tested on three different categories of complex urban building structures in the study area. Then, morphological operations were applied to the extracted building footprints to increase the uniformity of the building boundaries and produce improved building perimeters. Thus, our approach bridges a significant gap in detecting building objects in diverse environments; the overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient of the proposed method are greater than 80% and 0.605, respectively.

However, the current geo-information systems lack automatic detection of several building characteristics inside the high-resolution satellite images. The accurate extraction of buildings characteristics helps the decision-makers to optimize urban planning and achieve better decisions. Furthermore, Building orientation angle is a very critical parameter in the accuracy of automated building detection algorithms. However, the traditional computer vision techniques lack accuracy, scalability, and robustness for building orientation angle detection. This paper proposes two different approaches to deep building orientation angle estimation in the high-resolution satellite image. Firstly, we propose a transfer deep learning approach for our estimation task. Secondly, we propose a novel optimized DCRN network consisting of pre-processing, scaled gradient layer, deep convolutional units, dropout layers, and regression end layer. The early proposed gradient layer helps the DCRN network to extract more helpful information and increase its performance. We have collected a building benchmark dataset that consists of building images in Riyadh city. The images used in the experiments are 15,190 buildings images. In our experiments, we have compared our proposed approaches and the other approaches in the literature. The proposed system has achieved the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) value of 1.24, the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.16, and the highest adjusted R-squared value of 0.99 using the RMS optimizer. The cost of processing time of our proposed DCRN architecture is 0.0113 ± 0.0141 s. Our proposed approach has proven its stability with the input building image contrast variation for all orientation angles. Our experimental results are promising, and it is suggested to be utilized in other building characteristics estimation tasks in high-resolution satellite images. © 2021 by the authors.

However, designing big data analysis through artificial intelligence faces some issues in terms of security, privacy, training data, and centralized architecture. In this article, blockchain-based IoT framework with artificial intelligence is proposed which presents the integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain for IoT applications. The performance of the proposed architecture is evaluated in terms of qualitative and quantitative measurement. For qualitative measurement, how the integration of blockchain and artificial intelligence addresses various issues are described with the description of AI oriented BC and BC oriented AI. The performance evaluation of proposed AI-BC architecture is evaluated and compared with existing techniques in qualitative measurement. The experimental analysis shows that the proposed framework performs better in comparison with the existing state of art techniques. © 2021 by the authors.

With the development of deep learning technology in the field of remote sensing, the accuracy of land use decoding has been greatly improved. However, no finer remote sensing image could directly obtain economic and social information and it has a high revisit cycle (low temporal resolution), while urban flooding often lasts only a few hours. Cities contain a large amount of “social sensing” data that records human socio-economic activities, and GIS is a natural discipline with strong socio-economic ties. We propose a new GeoSemantic2vec algorithm for urban function recognition based on the latest advances in natural language processing technology (BERT model), which utilizes the rich semantic information in urban POI data to portray urban functions. Taking the Wuhan flooding event in summer 2020 as an example, we identified 84.55% of the flooding locations in social media. We also use the new algorithm proposed in this paper to divide the main urban area of Wuhan into 8 types of urban functional zones (kappa coefficient is 0.615) and construct a “City Portrait” of flooding locations.

It draws on computer science, engineering, psychology, physiology, and neuroscience to computationally model, track, and classify human emotions and affective states. While the US once dominated the field in terms of research and citation from 1995–2015, China is now emerging as a global contender in research output, claiming second place for the most cited country from 2016–2020. This article maps the rhizomatic growth and development of scientific publications devoted to emotion-sensing AI technologies. It employs a bibliometric analysis that identifies major national contributors and international alliances in the field over the past 25 years. Contrary to the ongoing political rhetoric of a new Cold War, we argue that there are in fact vibrant AI research alliances and ongoing collaborations between the West and China, especially with the US, despite competing interests and ethical concerns. Our observations of historical data indicate two major collaborative networks: the “US/Asia-Pacific cluster” consisting of the US, China, Singapore, Japan and the “European” cluster of Germany, the UK, and the Netherlands. Our analysis also uncovers a major shift in the focus of affective computing research away from diagnosis and detection of mental illnesses to more commercially viable applications in smart city design.

When information about mobility flows is not available for a particular region of interest, we must rely on mathematical models to generate them. In this work, we propose Deep Gravity, an effective model to generate flow probabilities that exploits many features (e.g., land use, road network, transport, food, health facilities) extracted from voluntary geographic data, and uses deep neural networks to discover non-linear relationships between those features and mobility flows. Our experiments, conducted on mobility flows in England, Italy, and New York State, show that Deep Gravity achieves a significant increase in performance, especially in densely populated regions of interest, with respect to the classic gravity model and models that do not use deep neural networks or geographic data. Deep Gravity has good generalization capability, generating realistic flows also for geographic areas for which there is no data availability for training. Finally, we show how flows generated by Deep Gravity may be explained in terms of the geographic features and highlight crucial differences among the three considered countries interpreting the model’s prediction with explainable AI techniques. © 2021, The Author(s).","L.P. has been partially supported by EU project SoBigData++ grant agreement 871042.

At the same time, future smart cities need to support resilient environments against cyber-threats on their supported information and communication technologies (ICT). Therefore, the cybersecurity of future smart cities and their smart grids is of paramount importance, especially on how to detect cyber-attacks with growing uncertainties, such as frequent topological changes and RES of intermittent nature. Such raised uncertainties can cause a significant change in the underlying distribution of measurements and system states. In such an environment, historical measured data will not accurately exhibit the current network's operating point. Hence, future power grids’ dynamic behaviors within smart cities are much more complicated than the conventional ones, leading to incorrect classification of the new instances by the current attack detectors. In this paper, to address this problem, a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) is carefully designed by embedding the dynamically time-evolving power system's characteristics to accurately model the dynamic behaviors of modern power grids that are influenced by RES or system reconfiguration to distinguish natural smart grid changes and real-time attacks. The proposed framework's performance is evaluated using the IEEE 14-bus system using real-world load data with multiple attack cases such as attacks to the network after a line outage and combination of RES. Results confirm that the developed LSTM-based attack detection model has a generalization ability to catch modern power grids’ dynamic behaviors, excelling current traditional approaches in the designed case studies and achieves accuracy higher than 90% in all experiments. © 2021",Funding text 1: This work was supported by European Commission Horizon 2020 Marie Sk?odowska-Curie Actions Cofund program and T?BiTAK (Project Number: 120C080).; Funding text 2: This work was supported by European Commission Horizon 2020 Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Actions Cofund program and T\u00DCBiTAK (Project Number: 120C080).,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85117711985,Yes,Turkey,Energy,Smart Grid & Energy,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Machine Learning (unspecified),Classification,Detect malicious cyber-attacks in smart grids for cyber-resilient smart cities,"SDG 7 (Energy), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 16 (Governance)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

In the past century, more than 1100 destructive earthquakes occurred, and caused around 1.5 million deaths worldwide. Some recent studies have suggested that a future earthquake in the Himalayan region of magnitude range MW 7.5–8 can cause more than 0.2 million human lives and around 150 billion dollar financial loss. Deep learning methods in recent studies proved very useful in natural hazards forecasting and prediction modelling. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model has been particularly popular in several natural hazard forecasting. In this research, for the first time, LSTM model is implemented with suitable Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) techniques to assess the earthquake vulnerability for whole of India. In India, most of the seismic vulnerability assessment available are at city level or state level using traditional techniques. Several factors such as land use, geology, geomorphology, fault distribution, transportation facility, population density were all used to develop the social, structural, and geotechnical vulnerability maps. The results show that the areas around Delhi, NE region of India, major parts of Gujrat, West Bengal plain exhibit high to very-high seismic vulnerability. This model achieved an accuracy of 87.8%, sensitivity (90%) and specificity (84.9%). The present analysis can be helpful towards prioritization of regions which are in higher need of risk reduction interventions.

The destructive effects of floods are magnified in cities. Accurate models of urban flood susceptibility are required to mitigate this hazard mitigation and build resilience in cities. In this paper, we evaluate flood riskin Jiroft city, Iran, using a combination of machine learning and decision-making methods. Flood hazard maps were created using three state-of-the-art machine learning methods (support vector machine, random forest, and boosted regression tree). The metadata supporting our analysis comprises 218 flood inundation points and a variety of derived factors: slope aspect, elevation, slope angle, rainfall, distance to streets, distance to rivers, land use/land cover, distance to urban drainages, urban drainage density, and curve number. We then employed the TOPSIS decision-making tool for urban flood vulnerability analysis, which is based on socio-economic factors such as building density, population density, building history, and socio-economic conditions. Finally, we derived an urban flood risk map for Jiroft based on flood hazard and vulnerability maps. Of the three models tested, the random forest model yielded the most accurate map. The results indicate that urban drainage density and distance to urban drainages are the most important factors in urban flood hazard modeling. As might be expected, areas with a high or very high population density are most vulnerable to flooding. These results show that flood risk mapping provide insights for priority planning in flood risk management, especially in areas with limited hydrological data. © 2021 The Authors",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116610049,Yes,Iran,Water,Disaster Management,Urban Resilience & Safety,"SVM, Random Forest, BRT",Classification,Evaluate urban flood risk using hybrid TOPSIS and machine learning methods,"SDG 6 (Water), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 13 (Climate)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

However, the lack and imbalance of research data and the insufficient performance of the model have led to the complexity and uncontrollability of flood forecasting. To forecast coastal floods accurately and reliably, the Internet of Things technology is used to collect data on floods and flood factors in smart cities. An ensemble learning method based on Bayesian model combination (BMC-EL) is designed to predict flood depth. First, flood intensity classification and K-fold cross-validation are introduced to generate multiple training subsets from the training set to realize uniform sampling and increase the diversity of subsets. Second, the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and random forest (RF) are used as the base learners to build the prediction model and then import it into training subsets for training purposes. Finally, based on the prediction performance of the base learner in the validation sets, the Bayesian model combination strategy is formulated to integrate and output predicted values. We describe experiments conducted to forecast flood depth 1 h in advance that several machine learning models were trained and tested using real flood data taken from Macao, China. The models include linear regression, support vector machine, BPNN, RF and BMC-EL models.

The value of these parameters are increasing steadily which has adverse effects on human life and human health and is also the cause of various disease like cancers and lung disease. It is now essential to monitor the environmental parameters of a region frequently. For the automatic continuous monitoring of environmental parameters of any location, this paper proposes to use vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), which is one of the promising subclasses of mobile ad hoc network (MANET). Automatic monitoring of environmental parameters of any location includes measurement of environmental parameters of a location, transmission of environmental parameters from the measured location to the observation center, and analysis of the parameters at the observation center. Two aspects are discussed for the transmission of parameters from the location of measurement to the observation center: first by vehicular communication and second by vehicular cloud. The analysis of the environmental parameters at the observation center is done using probabilistic neural network (PNN). Apart from this, different generic network parameters like end-to-end delay, number of hops, and network gaps for the proposed work are computed for the transmission of different environmental parameters and is compared with different VANET routing protocols like geographic source routing (GSR), anchor-based street and traffic-aware routing (A-STAR), and peripheral node-based geographic distance routing (P-GEDIR). Vehicular motion is created using Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO), and the network parameter values, like end-to-end delay and number of hops, are obtained using OMNET++.

The difficulty of pedestrian segmentation lies in the scene's complexity where the pedestrian is located, including the pedestrian's shooting angle, light, and obstructions, which makes it difficult to distinguish accurately. This paper proposes an S-Mask-RCNN network that integrates spatial attention mechanisms for pedestrian segmentation. Mask-RCNN uses residual neural networks in the feature extraction network, and the effect of model feature extraction is not ideal. Based on transfer learning, a spatial attention mechanism is introduced to focus more spatially on areas that need attention. The force mechanism focuses more on the areas that need attention in space. Experiments show that the S-Mask-RCNN method proposed in this paper has better performance than traditional Mask-RCNN in pedestrian segmentation.

In most such scenarios, the data generated by IoT sensors is not confidential, but its integrity is critical. Data integrity can be achieved by establishing certification mechanisms that provide cryptographic message authentication protocols; however, this requires relatively expensive components for storing and processing the encryption key on the sensor and consumes more power while processing and transmitting data, which leads to the renunciation of security issues in cost sensitive deployments. In this paper, we propose a security solution that provides data integrity without draining the batteries of IoT sensors. Our solution consists of, (i) differentiating legitimate sensors by taking advantage of their impurities formed during the manufacturing process of the transceiver components, and (ii) eliminating the complex components that carry out cryptography as well as the redundant packet header fields, thereby yielding power savings. The testbed implementation of the proposed solution yields power measurement results providing an estimate of 2.52 times improvement in battery life without compromising the integrity of communications in the system, in addition to offering an increase in spectral efficiency and a decrease in the overall IoT device cost. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Taskin Kocak’s broad research interests and expertise span the areas of computer systems, computer networks, and GPU parallel computing.

The proposed model involves different stages of operations such as data acquisition, preprocessing, feature selection, classification, and parameter optimization. The proposed model involves preprocessing to discard the noise that exists in the data. Then, the presented model uses binary bacterial foraging optimization (BBFO) based feature selection technique to elect an optimal subset of features. Besides the gated recurrent unit (GRU) model is applied to identify the presence of intrusions in the industrial CPS environment. Finally, Nesterov-accelerated Adaptive Moment Estimation (NADAM) optimizer is applied for the hyperparameter optimization of the GRU model in such a way that the detection rate can be enhanced. In order to validate the performance of the BBFO-GRU model, a series of experiments were carried out using the data from industrial CPS and the resultant values highlighted the promising performance of the proposed model with an accuracy of 98.45%. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",This work is financially supported by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation (Government Order FENU-2020-0022).,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85115650136,Yes,Saudi Arabia,Safety/Crime,Security & Safety,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"Deep Learning, Cognitive Computing",Classification,Develop intelligent cognitive computing intrusion detection for industrial cyber-physical systems,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Past,Longitudinal,Strong

Therefore, it becomes necessary for logistics companies to find high-performance strategies to enhance their sustainability. Collaboration between companies appears as one of the promising solution that improves the freight transport efficiency of modern cities. Existing studies on collaborative transport did not sufficiently account for sustainability aspects and they mainly discuss the independent planning of decision-making problems with economic objectives. However, collaboration an integrated decision-making process can significantly ameliorate the effectiveness of urban transportation systems. This study addresses the issue of sustainable freight transportation planning by formulating and solving a collaborative and integrated two-echelon inventory, location and routing problem (2E-CILRP). The 2E-CILRP is formulated as a multi-objective integer programming model that minimizes logistics costs, CO<inf>2</inf> emissions and accident rate. A hybrid heuristic based on machine learning is also introduced to solve the studied problem. The proposed approach combines k-means clustering and genetic algorithms. Comparison of the obtained results with those provided with exact method reveals that the developed approach is more efficient and more practical for designing integrated and collaborative networks with large-sized data. A case study of four agri-food SMEs in France is investigated in order to demonstrate the sustainable benefits of the developed optimization approach. The obtained results suggest that the developed approach can significantly reduce the level of CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, logistics costs and accident rate caused by transportation in cities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85115636936,Yes,France,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Optimization Algorithm,Optimization,Optimize sustainable cities freight transportation using collaborative strategy,"SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption), SDG 13 (Climate)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

We developed a random forest model to estimate daily PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations at 1 km2 resolution in and around industrialized Gauteng Province, South Africa, by combining satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD), meteorology, land use, and socioeconomic data. We then compared PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations in the study domain before and after the implementation of the new national air quality standards. We aimed to test whether machine learning models are suitable for regions with sparse ground observations such as South Africa and which predictors played important roles in PM<inf>2.5</inf> modeling. The cross-validation R2 and Root Mean Square Error of our model was 0.80 and 9.40 μg/m3, respectively. Satellite AOD, seasonal indicator, total precipitation, and population were among the most important predictors. Model-estimated PM<inf>2.5</inf> levels successfully captured the temporal pattern recorded by ground observations. Spatially, the highest annual PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentration appeared in central and northern Gauteng, including northern Johannesburg and the city of Tshwane. Since the 2016 changes in national PM<inf>2.5</inf> standards, PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations have decreased in most of our study region, although levels in Johannesburg and its surrounding areas have remained relatively constant. This is anadvanced PM<inf>2.5</inf> model for South Africa with high prediction accuracy at the daily level and at a relatively high spatial resolution. Our study provided a reference for predictor selection, and our results can be used for a variety of purposes, including epidemiological research, burden of disease assessments, and policy evaluation. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Funding text 1: This work was partially supported by the MAIA science team at the JPL, California Institute of Technology, led by D.

Previous studies have lacked human-oriented technical paths and high-throughput datasets to quantify physical and psychological perceptions in different land-use scenarios. This paper adopts a novel transfer learning approach to quantify the six types of landsense indices (LSIs) as psychological perception metrics and employs panoptic segmentation to parameterize the view index (VI) and the number of foreground instances (NFIs) as physical perception measures. Then, a quantitative analysis is conducted in Beijing's six Ring Road areas, and the connections between people's physical and psychological perceptions of heterogeneous land use are explored. The landsense maps can depict the distribution of LSIs and facilitate the understanding of complex perceptions distributed at a large scale. The regression model shows that natural landscapes (trees, grasses, and mountains) in the Beijing built-up area exhibit an overall positive performance. Moreover, for several block-level land uses, industrial scenery is related to overall negative psychological feelings. Parks and green spaces are positively related to psychological perceptions, because of the greater exposure opportunities to natural landscapes for residents. The framework in this research has potential in assisting urban planning and land-use management, and it enriches the datasets with extensive information, thereby improving the psychological perceptions of urban scenes from residents’ perspectives. The novel approaches in this paper take a step forward in quantifying and understanding the public perceptions of urban landscapes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","All authors dedicate this article to the memory of Prof. Jingzhu Zhao, a great sustainability specialist, leader and mentor.

In order to improve the safety of smart cities, a situation prediction method based on feature separation and dual attention mechanism is presented in this paper. Firstly, according to the fact that the intrusion activity is a time series event, recurrent neural network (RNN) or RNN variant is used to stack the model. Then, we propose a feature separation method, which can alleviate the overfitting problem and reduce cost of model training by keeping the dimension unchanged. Finally, limited attention is proposed according to global attention. We sum the outputs of the two attention modules to form a dual attention mechanism, which can improve feature representation. Experiments have proved that compared with other existing prediction algorithms, the method has higher accuracy in network security situation prediction.

In recent years, researchers have started relying more on photo-based, geotagged social data, which offer insights about tourists, popular hotspots, and mobility patterns. However, distinguishing between tourists and locals from this data is problematic since residence information is often not provided. While previous studies rely on heuristic (e.g., period of stay) and probabilistic (Shannon entropy) approaches, this paper proposes a method for classifying tourists and residents based on machine learning (ML) algorithms and considering parameters that could explain the variability between the two (e.g., weather, mobility, and photo content). This approach was applied to Flickr users’ geotagged photos taken in Tokyo’s 23 special wards from July 2008 to December 2019. The results show that stacked ensemble (SE) models are superior to models based on five supervised-learning algorithms, including gradient boosting machine (GBM), generalized linear model (GLM), distributed random forest (DRF), deep learning (DL), and extremely randomized trees (XRT). Temporal entropy (TEN), mobility on workdays, and frequent visits to amusement venues and crowded places influenced how users were classified. While temporal distribution showed similar monthly/hourly patterns, spatial distribution varied. The proposed approach might pave the way for scholars to carry out future tourism research on different topics and subsequently support policymakers in the decision-making process, specifically in urban settings. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",This work is part of the research outcomes funded by JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Challenging Exploratory Research KAKENHI (Grant Number: 17H00843).

Many studies on estimating PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations have been performed using statistical regression models and satellite remote sensing. However, the accuracy of PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentration estimates is limited by traditional regression models; machine learning methods have high predictive power, but fewer studies have been performed on the complementary advantages of different approaches. This study estimates PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations from satellite remote sensing-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) products, meteorological data, terrain data and other predictors in 2015 in Shaanxi, China, using a combined genetic algorithm-support vector machine (GA-SVM) method, after which the spatial clustering pattern was explored at the season and year levels. The results indicated that temperature (r = −0.684), precipitation (r = −0.602) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (r = −0.523) were significantly negatively correlated with the PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentration, while AOD (r = 0.337) was significantly positively correlated with the PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentration. Compared to conventional land use regression (LUR) and SVM models and previous related studies, the GA-SVM method demonstrated a significantly better prediction accuracy of PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentration, with a higher 10-fold cross-validation coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.84 and lower root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of 12.1 μg/m3 and 10.07 μg/m3, respectively. Y-scrambling test shows that the models have no chance correlation. The central and southern parts of Shaanxi have high PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations, which are mainly due to the pollutant emissions and meteorological and topographical conditions in those areas. There was a positive spatial agglomeration characteristic of regional PM<inf>2.5</inf> pollution, and the spatial spillover effect of PM<inf>2.5</inf> pollution for seasonal and annual variations does exist. In general, the GA-SVM method is robust and accurately estimates PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations via a novel modeling framework application and high-quality spatiotemporal information. It also has great significance for the exploration of PM<inf>2.5</inf> pollution estimation and high-precision mapping methods, especially early warning in high-risk areas. Finally, the prevention and control of atmospheric pollution should take pollution control measures from major cities and surrounding cities, and focus on the joint pollution control measures for plain cities. © 2021 The Authors","This research was supported by the Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi (Program No. 2021JM-447 ), the Scientific Research Program Funded by Shaanxi Provincial Education Department (Program No. 17JK0325 ), the Fund Project of Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Land Consolidation ( 2018-JC12 ), the Project funded by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation ( 2017M610119 ).",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114843858,Yes,China,Environment,Environment & Sustainability,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,GA-SVM,Prediction/Forecasting,Estimate PM2.5 concentration using GA-SVM machine learning to improve land use regression,"SDG 3 (Health), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 13 (Climate)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

A central administrator appointed by the government manages and maintains the security of each node. Smart City relies upon millions of sensors that are heterogeneous and do not support standard security architecture. Different manufacturers have weak protection protocols for their products and do not update their firmware upon newly identified operating systems’ vulnerabilities. Adversaries using brute force methods exploit the lack of inbuilt security systems on IoT devices to grow their bot network. Smart cities require a standard framework combining soft computing and Deep Learning (DL) for device fleet management and complete control of sensor operating systems for absolute security. This paper presents a real-world application for IoT fleet management security using a lightweight container-based botnet detection (C-BotDet) framework. Using a three-phase approach, the framework using Artificial Intelligence detects compromised IoT devices sending malicious traffic on the network. Balena Cloud revokes API keys and prevents a compromised device from infecting other devices to form a more giant botnet. VPN (Virtual Private Network) prevents inter-device communication and routes all malicious traffic through an external server. The framework quickly updates the standard Linux-based operating system IoT device fleet without relying on different manufacturers to update their system security individually. The simulation and analysis of the C-BotDet framework are presented in a practical working environment to demonstrate its implementation feasibility. © 2021",This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (NRF- 2019R1A2B5B0107041613 ).,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114806873,Yes,South Korea,Safety/Crime,Security & Safety,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,LSTM,Classification,Secure smart cities against botnet attacks using LSTM and lightweight containers,"SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 16 (Governance)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

This study sought to identify built environment factors that are associated with variations in prenatal care and subsequent pregnancy-related outcomes in an urban setting. Methods: In a retrospective observational study, we characterized the types and frequency of prenatal care events that are associated with the various built environment factors of the patients’ residing neighborhoods. In comparison to women living in higher-quality built environments, we hypothesize that women who reside in lower-quality built environments experience different patterns of clinical events that may increase the risk for adverse outcomes. Using machine learning, we performed pattern detection to characterize the variability in prenatal care concerning encounter types, clinical problems, and medication prescriptions. Structural equation modeling was used to test the associations among built environment, prenatal care variation, and pregnancy outcome. The main outcome is postpartum depression (PPD) diagnosis within 1 year following childbirth. The exposures were the quality of the built environment in the patients’ residing neighborhoods. Electronic health records (EHR) data of pregnant women (n = 8,949) who had live delivery at an urban academic medical center from 2015 to 2017 were included in the study. Results: We discovered prenatal care patterns that were summarized into three common types. Women who experienced the prenatal care pattern with the highest rates of PPD were more likely to reside in neighborhoods with homogeneous land use, lower walkability, lower air pollutant concentration, and lower retail floor ratios after adjusting for age, neighborhood average education level, marital status, and income inequality. Conclusions: In an urban setting, multi-purpose and walkable communities were found to be associated with a lower risk of PPD. Findings may inform urban design policies and provide awareness for care providers on the association of patients’ residing neighborhoods and healthy pregnancy. © 2021, The Author(s).","This study was funded by the Center for Transportation, Environment, and Community Health New Research Initiatives Fund.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114312834,Yes,United States,Public Health,Health & Well-being,Social Equity & Quality of Life,Machine Learning (unspecified),Classification,Identify urban built environment factors affecting pregnancy care and maternal mental health,"SDG 3 (Health), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Past,Cross-sectional,Strong

It also has positive effects on urban vibrancy, public health, and social connections in that community. Numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate the visual quality at the urban street level using street view images. However, the spatial distribution of fine-grained visual quality inside an urban street is rarely investigated. This study presents a new approach for the evaluation of visual quality inside urban streets using mobile LiDAR point clouds. The semantic information of urban streets was first extracted from mobile LiDAR point clouds with a Gradient Boosting classifier. After that, seven well-known key design elements, including the green space factor, sky view factor, enclosure rate, volume index, vehicle occurrence rate, motorization rate, and diversity, were calculated from the classified point clouds using a three-dimensional (3D) visibility model. Finally, the visual quality at 1 m grid resolution inside urban street was achieved automatically by using a random forest model which was trained based on perception samples. This approach has been validated on two study areas and the results indicated that the proposed approach is able to quantitatively examine the visual quality difference inside urban streets.

The sustainable properties of smart city applications require less energy consumption and efficient resource allocation. The Internet-of-Things (IoT), 5G, and fog networks have emerged as the most crucial researched areas due to their numerous applications for smart cities to provide the desired sustainable outcome. The sustainable properties of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) play a vital role in the deployment of these technologies into the physical world and efficient utilization of the available spectrum is a major problem faced here. As a potential solution of this, Cognitive Radio (CR) merged with WSN as Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks (CRSNs) make the smart perspective with high resource management through cooperative communication.

Real-time processing of large-scale data streams is one of the main challenges of IoT systems. Analyzing IoT data can help in providing better services, predicting trends and timely decision making for industries. The systematic structure of IoT data follows the pattern of big data. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed in which big data tools are used to perform real-time stream processing and analysis on IoT data. We have also applied Spark’s built-in support of the machine learning library in order to make real-time predictions.

However, a core problem for such services is route planning for each driver to fulfill the dynamically arriving requests while satisfying given constraints. Current models are mostly limited to static routes with only two rides per vehicle (optimally) or three (with heuristics) (Alonso-Mora et al., 2017), at least in the initial allocation while not ascertaining that opposite-direction rides are not grouped together. In this paper, we present a dynamic, demand aware, and pricing-based vehicle-passenger matching and route planning framework that (1) dynamically generates optimal routes for each vehicle based on online demand, pricing associated with each ride, vehicle capacities and locations. This matching algorithm starts greedily and optimizes over time using an insertion operation, (2) involves drivers in the decision-making process by allowing them to propose a different price based on the expected reward for a particular ride as well as the destination locations for future rides, which is influenced by supply-and-demand computed by the Deep Q-network. (3) allows customers to accept or reject rides based on their set of preferences with respect to pricing and delay windows, vehicle type and carpooling preferences. These (1-3) in tandem with each other enforce grouping rides with the most route-intersections together. (4) Based on demand prediction, our approach re-balances idle vehicles by dispatching them to the areas of anticipated high demand using deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). Our framework is validated using millions of trips extracted from the New York City Taxi public dataset; however, we consider different vehicle types and designed customer utility functions to validate the setup and study different settings. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach in real-time and large scale settings. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","This work was supported in part by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs under Contract W81XWH-18-1-0769, in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant CNS-1618335, and in part by CISCO.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112603400,Yes,United States,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,Deep Reinforcement Learning,Optimization,Develop distributed model-free ride-sharing approach using deep reinforcement learning,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Methodological,Quantitative,Local,Future,Longitudinal,Weak

In order to better cope with the rapid growth of mobile data in the future, 5G also came into being. Then, B5G was proposed and applied in industries such as traditional voice/video, smart city, automotive car or ship, unmanned aerial vehicle, marine monitoring, IoT, and intelligent industry. In these scenarios, B5G is required to achieve seamless global coverage. As these scenarios are complex and changeable, analysis of the coverage of 5G base stations has become a challenge. We decompose the environment around the base station into multiple grids, and analyze the signal strength of each grid. A signal propagation model needs to be constructed to predict whether each grid is covered. The commonly used wireless propagation model is an empirical model based on a mathematical formula for statistical analysis of a large amount of test data during the establishment of a 5G local area network. It has universal applicability, but has insufficient prediction accuracy for specific scenarios. Therefore, it is necessary to calibrate and modify the typical propagation model according to the specific environment to obtain an accurate propagation model that matches the current area. We improved the traditional wireless communication model, and proposed a deep-learning-based B5G coverage analysis method named Dubhe which is one of the planets of the Big Dipper. In a real cell scenario, the mean square error of the link budget of the typical UMa model is 17.9 dBm, while the mean square error of the proposed Dubhe model constructed in this article is only 6.78 dBm.

Crowd counting is a promising field in data analysis of AIoT, however, due to poor transparency and high data security risks, developing a novel network architecture that can precisely elevate the counting of heavy crowd is extremely difficult. In addition, the fusion of IoT and AI also poses several challenges. The focus of this work is on the effective design of IoT framework and deep learning algorithm towards security of smart city. The system can be used to estimate the crowd traffic in public places, and can prevent the occurrence of congestion, stampede and other accidents, such as stations, airports, large-scale exhibitions, tourist attractions and other places. The constructed system contains video collection, upload and display as well as data analysis and early warning operation at the embedded device end, and automatically tracks densely crowd areas by controlling the video monitoring device. Moreover, the cloud platform can be controlled through the network. Our proposed algorithms are composed of two main aspects, i.e., division and focus. Firstly, we propose a novel density-adaptive Gaussian kernel to elevate the quality of density maps. Then, we propose a module based on conditional random fields for feature fusion.

A corresponding data transformation tool, originally designed to work alongside CityGML, was extended. This allowed for the transformation of original data into a form of semantic triples. We compared various scalable technologies for this semantic data storage and chose Blazegraph™ as it provided the required geospatial search functionality. We also evaluated scalable hardware data solutions and file systems using the publicly available CityGML 2.0 data of Charlottenburg in Berlin, Germany as a working example. The structural isomorphism of the CityGML schemas and the OntoCityGML Tbox allowed the data to be transformed without loss of information. Efficient geospatial search algorithms allowed us to retrieve building data from any point in a city using coordinates. The use of named graphs and namespaces for data partitioning ensured the system performance stayed well below its capacity limits.

The forecasting was performed for three periods of time: 1 week, 1 month and 1 year. The vehicular traffic flow data analysed were collected from Interstate 87, a highway located within the U.S. state of New York. Temporal and climate information, such as weekday, time of day, precipitation, visibility and temperature, were provided to the ANNs. Two different architectures were implemented to forecast vehicular traffic flow: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The performance was evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and comparing the predicted flow with the real data in the evaluated period. The MLP resulted in RMSE of 113.96, 185.98 and 201.19, and MAP of 9.56%, 15.49% and 16.95% for a forecasting interval of 1 week, 1 month and 1 year, respectively.

Computation offloading involves moving data from IoT devices to another processing layer with higher processing capability. However, the size of data offloaded is directly proportional to the delay incurred by the offloading. Therefore, introducing data reduction technique to reduce the offloadable data minimizes delay resulting from the offloading method. In this paper, two main strategies are proposed to address the enormous data volume that result to computation offloading delay. First, IoT Canonical Polyadic Decomposition for Deep Learning Algorithm is proposed. The main purpose of this strategy is to downsize the IoT offloadable data. In the study, the Kaggle-cat-and-dog dataset was used to evaluate the impact of the proposed data compression. The proposed method downsizes the data significantly and can reduce the delay due to network traffic. Secondly, Rank Accuracy Estimation Model is proposed for determining the Rank-1 value.

Smart or precision farming is known for achieving intelligence in agriculture. Therefore, in this article, an effort has been made towards automated disease detection from the plant leaves. For this a novel framework, a method named as IoT_FBFN using Fuzzy Based Function Network (FBFN) enabled with IoT has been proposed. At first, the images of leaf are acquired. Then these images are preprocessed and features are extracted using the Scale-invariant feature transform method. Finally, FBFN is used for the detection of the galls caused by the insect named as Pauropsyllatuberculate. The training process of the network is by optimizing with the help of Firefly algorithm, this increases the efficiency of the network. The proposed IoT_FBFN network having the computational power of fuzzy logic and learning adaptability of neural network achieves higher accuracy for identification and classification of galls when compared with the other approaches.

The extraction of the accurate building footprints in densely populated urban areas from medium resolution satellite images is still a challenging task which requires the development of the new methods to solve such problem. In this paper, a novel Dilated-ResUnet deep learning architecture for building extraction from Sentinel-2 satellite images has been proposed. The proposed model has been tested on three novel building datasets that are prepared for three densely populated cities of India (viz. Delhi, Hyderabad and Bengaluru) using Sentinel-2 satellite images and Planet OSM. First FCC (false colour composite) dataset prepared by merging NIR, Red, Green bands, second FCC dataset prepared by merging NIR, Red, Green and Blue bands and third is TCC (true colour composite) dataset by merging red, green and blue bands. The proposed architecture is applied to both the FCC datasets and TCC dataset separately; it has been identified that the proposed model has obtained better building extraction results using FCC (NIR, Red, Green) dataset. The input satellite image enhancement and extensive experimentations to identify the optimal deep learning hyper-parameters using FCC spatial dataset have also been carried out to further improve the performance of the proposed model. The results of the experimentations reveal that the proposed model has out-performed the state of the art models available in literature by achieving the F1-score of 0.4718 and Mean IoU of 0.582 for building extraction from Sentinel-2 satellite images.

Precise energy consumption prediction (ECP) and integrated local energy systems (ILES) are critical to boost clean energy management systems between consumers and suppliers. Various obstacles such as environmental factors and occupant behavior affects the performance of existing approaches for long- and short-term ECP. Thus, to address such concerns, we present a novel hybrid network model ‘DB-Net’ by incorporating a dilated convolutional neural network (DCNN) with bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM). The proposed approach allows efficient control of power energy in ILES between consumer and supplier when employed for long- and short-term ECP. The first phase combines data acquisition and refinement procedures into a preprocessing module in which the main goal is to optimize the collected data and to handle outliers. In the next phase, the refined data is passed into DCNN layers for feature encoding followed by BiLSTM layers to learn hidden sequential patterns and decode the feature maps. In the final phase, the DB-Net model forecasts multi-step power consumption (PC), including hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly output. The proposed approach attains better predictive performance than existing methods, thereby confirming its effectiveness. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2019M3F2A1073179).,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85109725008,Yes,South Korea,Energy,Smart Grid & Energy,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Dilated CNN (DB-Net),Prediction/Forecasting,Forecast power consumption in integrated local energy systems using dilated CNN,"SDG 7 (Energy), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Individual,Future,Longitudinal,Strong

The habitat quality of coastal has gradually deteriorated with economic development, but the concept of ""ecological construction"" has slowed the negative trend. For quantitative analysis of the correlation between the Pearl River Delta urban expansion and changes in habitat quality under the influence of the policy, we first analyzed the habitat quality change based on the InVEST model and then measured the impact of construction land expansion on the habitat quality through habitat quality change index (HQCI) and contribution index (CI) indicators. Finally, the correlation between urbanization level and habitat quality was evaluated using geographically weighted regression (GWR) and the Self-organizing feature mapping neural network (SOFM). The results indicated that: (1) during the study period from 2000 to 2020, habitat quality declined due to urban sprawl, indicating a deterioration of ecological structure and function, and the decrease was most significant from 2000 to 2010. (2) The urbanization index had a negative effect on the habitat quality, but the negative effect have improved after 2000, reflecting the positive effect of policies such as ""ecological civilization construction"" (3) The implementation degree of ecological civilization varies greatly among cities in the study area: Shenzhen, Dongguan, Foshan, and Zhongshan have the best level of green development.

However, these C stocks are threatened by forest land conversion. Land use change has global impacts and is a critical component when studying C fluxes, but it is not always fully considered in C accounting despite being a major contributor to emissions. An urgent need exists among decision-makers to identify the likelihood of forest conversion to other land uses and factors affecting C loss. To help address this issue, we conducted our research in California, Colorado, Georgia, New York, Texas, and Wisconsin. The objectives were to (1) model the probability of forest conversion and C stocks dynamics using USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data and (2) create wall-to-wall maps showing estimates of the risk of areas to convert from forest to non-forest. We used two modeling approaches: a machine learning algorithm (random forest) and generalized mixed-effects models. Explanatory variables for the models included ecological attributes, topography, census data, forest disturbances, and forest conditions. Model predictions and Landsat spectral information were used to produce wall-to-wall probability maps of forest change using Google Earth Engine. Results: During the study period (2000–2017), 3.4% of the analyzed FIA plots transitioned from forest to mixed or non-forested conditions. Results indicate that the change in land use from forests is more likely with increasing human population and housing growth rates. Furthermore, non-public forests showed a higher probability of forest change compared to public forests. Areas closer to cities and coastal areas showed a higher risk of transition to non-forests. Out of the six states analyzed, Colorado had the highest risk of conversion and the largest amount of aboveground C lost. Natural forest disturbances were not a major predictor of land use change. Conclusions: Land use change is accelerating globally, causing a large increase in C emissions. Our results will help policy-makers prioritize forest management activities and land use planning by providing a quantitative framework that can enhance forest health and productivity. This work will also inform climate change mitigation strategies by understanding the role that land use change plays in C emissions. © 2021, The Author(s).","This work was supported by the US Department of Agriculture—Forest Service, Northern Research Station (project 14-JV-11242305-012), the Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station (project MIN-42-101), and University of Minnesota Department of Forest Resources fellowship program.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85109288489,No,United States,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although some techniques are available for the indoor localization of elderly persons, in the coming years, outdoor localization will be an essential part of society. Different approaches such as GPS, range-based, and range-free have been developed for outdoor localization. However, the localization accuracy and precision is still a significant challenge. For accurate and low-cost localization, we propose a novel IoT-based range-based localization for smart city applications. Using the extreme learning machine (ELM), fuzzy system, and modified swarm intelligence, a hybrid optimized fuzzy threshold ELM (HOFTELM) algorithm is developed. The particle swarm grey wolf optimization is used to identify the direction of the moving sensor node. A fuzzy weighted centroid is used to optimize the consequences of irregular movement of the nodes. Lastly, an optimized threshold extreme learning machine and weighted mean are applied to localize the moving nodes accurately. Our algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of average location error ratio (ALER), the number of localized nodes, and the computational time. The results show that ALER reduces by at least 48.07% in comparison with the other algorithms.

However, the above methods have a critical challenge: data privacy. GAN will leak the semantic information of the training data which can be used to reconstruct the training samples by attackers, thereby this method will leak the privacy of the patient. Furthermore, for this reason, that is the limitation of the training data sample, different hospitals jointly train the model through data sharing, which will also cause privacy leakage. To solve this problem, we adopt the Federated Learning (FL) framework, a new technique being used to protect data privacy. Under the FL framework and Differentially Private thinking, we propose a Federated Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Network (FedDPGAN) to detect COVID-19 pneumonia for sustainable smart cities. Specifically, we use DP-GAN to privately generate diverse patient data in which differential privacy technology is introduced to make sure the privacy protection of the semantic information of the training dataset. Furthermore, we leverage FL to allow hospitals to collaboratively train COVID-19 models without sharing the original data. Under Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) and non-IID settings, the evaluation of the proposed model is on three types of chest X-ray (CXR)images dataset (COVID-19, normal, and normal pneumonia).

We consider street context as the inferred usage of the street, based on its buildings and construction, categorized in nine possible labels. The labels define whether the street is residential, commercial or downtown, throughway or not, and other special categories. We apply the analysis to the City of Boston, considering daily trajectories synthetically generated with a model based on call detail records (CDR) and images from Google Street View. Images are categorized both manually and using artificial intelligence (AI). We focus on the city’s four main racial/ethnic demographic groups (White, Black, Hispanic and Asian), aiming to characterize the differences in what these groups of people see during their daily activities. Based on daily trajectories, we reconstruct most common paths over the street network. We use street demand (number of times a street is included in a trajectory) to detect each group’s most relevant streets and regions. Based on their street demand, we measure the street context distribution for each group. The inclusion of images allows us to quantitatively measure the prevalence of each context and points to qualitative differences on where that context takes place. Other AI methodologies can further exploit these differences. This approach presents the building blocks to further studies that relate mobile devices’ dynamic records with the differences in urban exposure by demographic groups. The addition of AI-based image analysis to street demand can power up the capabilities of urban planning methodologies, compare multiple cities under a unified framework, and reduce the crudeness of GIS-only mobility analysis. Shortening the gap between big data-driven analysis and traditional human classification analysis can help build smarter and more equal cities while reducing the efforts necessary to study a city’s characteristics. © 2021, The Author(s).",MCG was supported by the Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory under U.S. Department of Energy Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107800967,Yes,Argentina,Social Equity,Social & Demographics,Social Equity & Quality of Life,Not Specified,Classification,Characterize demographic groups' exposure to street context types in daily mobility,"SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

For example, IoT devices can automatically recognize emotional states through collected facial expressions, which can further serve mental health assessment, human-computer interaction, etc. On the other hand, existing facial expression recognition algorithms emphasize the application of deep neural networks (DNNs), and it is difficult for resource-constrained IoT devices to provide sufficient computing resources to optimize parameters for DNN-based structures. To solve the challenge of resource constraints, we propose the hierarchical emotion recognition system enabled by mobile edge computing (MEC). Specifically, MEC nodes provide IoT devices with short-delay and high-performance computing services, satisfying the requirements of training DNN-based algorithms. Moreover, our proposed emotion recognition system leverages a pretrained feature extraction module on the remote cloud to accelerate optimization and provides a localization module for specific tasks of IoT devices. In addition to evaluating the accuracy and efficiency, we also clarify that the DNN-based emotion recognition system exposes obvious vulnerability to perturbation. Due to the uncertainty of the environment, it is common for facial expressions collected by IoT devices to be accompanied by perturbation. To address this issue, we propose the proactive perturbation-aware defense mechanism. It has been demonstrated that the newly proposed defense mechanism can maintain state-of-the-art performance on the publicly available LIRIS-CSE dataset while defending against known and unknown perturbation. This can promote the deployment of our proposed MEC-enabled hierarchical emotion recognition system and defense mechanism in real-world scenarios. © 2014 IEEE.",This work was supported in part by the China National Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists under Grant 61825204; in part by NSFC Project under Grant 61932016; in part by Beijing Outstanding Young Scientist Program under Grant BJJWZYJH01201910003011; in part by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2018YFB0803405; in part by Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology (BNRist) under Grant BNR2019RC01011; and in part by PCL Future Greater- Bay Area Network Facilities for Largescale Experiments and Applications under Grant LZC0019.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105891477,Yes,China,Public Health,Health & Well-being,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,DNN,Classification,Enable hierarchical emotion recognition with perturbation-aware defense in MEC smart cities,"SDG 3 (Health), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

Predicting delivery times successive to being shipped out of the final depot, referred to as last-mile prediction, deals with complicating factors such as traffic, drivers' behaviors, and weather. This work studies the use of deep learning for solving a real-world case of last-mile parcel delivery time prediction. We present our solution under the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm and discuss its feasibility on a cloud-based architecture as a smart city application. We focus on a large-scale parcel data set provided by Canada Post, covering the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). We utilize an origin-destination (OD) formulation, in which routes are not available, but only the start and end delivery points. We investigate three categories of convolutional-based neural networks and assess their performances on the task. We further demonstrate how our modeling outperforms several baselines, from classical machine learning models to referenced OD solutions. We perform a thorough error analysis across the data and visualize the deep features learned to better understand the model behavior, making interesting remarks on data predictability. Our work provides an end-to-end neural pipeline that leverages parcel OD data as well as weather to accurately predict delivery durations.

However, in many ways, it is not. This is due to two primary factors, one arising from each side of this encounter. First, legacies of overly-anthropomorphic models of AI permeate design discourses, where issues of how well AI can be constrained to social issues of philosophy of mind exclude more foundational and cross-cultural questions about artificial intelligence as material process in the physical world that could inform new philosophical insights. Concurrently, the mobilization of investment in “Smart Cities” discourses dominates the space of application of AI at urban scale in ways that prematurely fixes solutions in the skeuomorphic image of architectural and urban conventions. To break this impasse, we held a series of think-tanks, workshops, and design charettes that brought together leading figures in philosophy of artificial intelligence, urban design, and commercial AI platforms. The goal was to re-think from first principles how alternative philosophical models of AI as a distributed, discontinuous, landscape-scale technology in a direct encounter with the applications in contexts of ecological sensing, automation’s impact on urban form, and issues of algorithmic governance. The design brief for this research establishes a generative framework for conceiving how embedded machine sensing and intelligence is already changing urban form (but unrecognized) and could change it in the future (based on more appropriate design projections). The framework focuses on issues of urban zoning and architectural programming, data modeling and governance, platform cognition and design, and how these inform shifts in dynamics of public and private institutions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd. part of Springer Nature.","The most prevalent and popular models are those associated with the catch-all “Smart City,” a stale shorthand which has come to include the sensible and the silly. As a model of AI urbanism, however, it is crippled both by a lack of imagination as to what is possible beyond the simple automation of prosaic functions, and by a deep misrecognition of the already existing intelligence of urban systems. Its conceit, to introduce intelligence to systems that have none so that they can do what they have always done but slighter more efficiently, is wrongheaded on both priorities. Corollary to these are various “AI City” projects that promise a radical new way of architecture but which are, clearly to anyone who looks carefully, only the most conventional design banalities slathered with an “AI” marketing trope. By contrast, the approach we took to AI Urbanism at The New Normal think-tank at Strelka Institute in Moscow prioritizes the social and technical intelligence of existing urban systems and asks how, and indeed if, artificial intelligence can add to them, and if so, on what terms?

It was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It has resulted in an ongoing pandemic that caused infected cases including many deaths. Coronavirus is primarily spread between people during close contact. Motivating to this notion, this research proposes an artificial intelligence system for social distancing classification of persons using thermal images. By exploiting YOLOv2 (you look at once) approach, a novel deep learning detection technique is developed for detecting and tracking people in indoor and outdoor scenarios. An algorithm is also implemented for measuring and classifying the distance between persons and to automatically check if social distancing rules are respected or not. Hence, this work aims at minimizing the spread of the COVID-19 virus by evaluating if and how persons comply with social distancing rules. The proposed approach is applied to images acquired through thermal cameras, to establish a complete AI system for people tracking, social distancing classification, and body temperature monitoring. The training phase is done with two datasets captured from different thermal cameras. Ground Truth Labeler app is used for labeling the persons in the images. The proposed technique has been deployed in a low-cost embedded system (Jetson Nano) which is composed of a fixed camera. The proposed approach is implemented in a distributed surveillance video system to visualize people from several cameras in one centralized monitoring system. The achieved results show that the proposed method is suitable to set up a surveillance system in smart cities for people detection, social distancing classification, and body temperature analysis. © 2021, The Author(s).",We thank the Islamic Development Bank for their support to the Ph.D. work of A.

To prevent and control COVID-19, a range of smart, complex, spatially heterogeneous, control solutions, and strategies have been conducted. Earlier classification of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is needed to cure and control the disease. It results in a requirement of secondary diagnosis models, since no precise automated toolkits exist. The latest finding attained using radiological imaging techniques highlighted that the images hold noticeable details regarding the COVID-19 virus. The application of recent artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) approaches integrated to radiological images finds useful to accurately detect the disease. This article introduces a new synergic deep learning (SDL)-based smart health diagnosis of COVID-19 using Chest X-Ray Images. The SDL makes use of dual deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and involves a mutual learning process from one another. Particularly, the representation of images learned by both DCNNs is provided as the input of a synergic network, which has a fully connected structure and predicts whether the pair of input images come under the identical class. Besides, the proposed SDL model involves a fuzzy bilateral filtering (FBF) model to pre-process the input image. The integration of FBL and SDL resulted in the effective classification of COVID-19. To investigate the classifier outcome of the SDL model, a detailed set of simulations takes place and ensures the effective performance of the FBF-SDL model over the compared methods. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85126388299,Yes,India,Public Health,Health & Well-being,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Deep Learning (Synergic),Classification,Diagnose COVID-19 using synergic deep learning from radiological images for smart cities,"SDG 3 (Health), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

Nevertheless, the relationships found can be contradictory. This is primarily due to the fact that the cases studied are often in different regions with different climatic conditions. In addition, the influences of trees are sometimes ignored due to the lack of vegetation data or the limitation of calculating methods. How to calculate SVF quickly and accurately is important to urban climate research. SVF is typically calculated by four types of methods: fisheye photo methods, 3D GIS methods, GPS methods, and street view image methods. Compared with the other types of methods, calculating SVF using street view images has many advantages, such as widely available data, low cost, high efficiency, and the ability to consider the influences of trees and other obstacles. On the one hand, street view images provide the possibility for fast and accurate calculation of SVF in large-scale areas. On the other hand, the street view image method is still at its developing stage and more work needs to be done to verify its application in various urban environments. In this study, we proposed an automatic SVF calculation method using street view images and deep learning algorithms, and then applied the method to the UHI study in the city center of Shanghai. Baidu static panoramas and Deeplabv3+ were used to detect sky range while MATLAB code was written to calculate SVF. A Landsat-8 OLI / TIRS image was also used to retrieve land surface temperature at street level in the study area. Based on the Local Climate Zones (LCZ) scheme, we combined large-scale SVF value with the land use and building morphology to examine the relationship between SVF and UHI intensity. The results showed that Deeplabv3+ can detect the sky and non-sky range effectively in different scenarios (MIOU=91.64%). The SVF calculated using the proposed method was in good agreement with that calculated using fish-eye photos (R2=0.8869). The LCZ scheme provides new insights for the relationship between SVF and UHI. For LCZ5 and LCZ1, the highest correlation coefficients were 0.68 and -0.79, respectively. The proposed method was shown to be applicable in high-density and complex urban environments. In addition, the calculation of large-scale continuous SVF provides the possibility for zonal understandings of the UHI effect based on the LCZ scheme. 2021, Science Press.

The current pandemic situation has given the world an alarm to act towards the reduction/eradication of carbon footprint. Developing countries like India are striving hard to strike a balance between sustainability and global growth. To support the nation, certain measures and their prioritization would be helpful. Motivated by this notion, in this study, a new framework is proposed with double hierarchy fuzzy information, which not only gives experts a better style to articulate preferences linguistically but also makes a rational decision with methodical support. Mayor's transport strategy, 2018 is a popular document that provides valuable information towards sustainable transport practices, and the measures considered in this study are adapted from the same. In this framework, (i) a novel attitudinal evidence-based Bayesian approach is proposed for criteria weight estimation; (ii) experts’ weights are determined by using variance approach, and (iii) Evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS) approach is extended for prioritizing zero-carbon measures. These approaches are integrated into a framework and its practicality is exemplified by considering a case example of prioritizing measures for a smart city in India.

Existing LU simulation models extract neighborhood effects with only one data time slice, which ignores long-term dependence in neighborhood interactions. Previous studies on the dynamic relationship between LU change and ES in semi-arid areas is rare than that in humid coastal areas. Here, we selected a semi-arid city, Lanzhou, in Northwest China as the study area, to simulate LU changes in 2030 under natural growth (NG), ecological protection (EP), economic development (EP), and ecological protection-economic development (EPD) scenarios, using a novel deep learning method, named CL-CA. Convolutional neural network and long short term memory (CNN-LSTM) with cellular automata (CA) were utilized to extract the spatiotemporal neighborhood features. The overall simulation performance of the proposed model was larger than 0.92, which is surpassed that of LSTM-CA, artificial neural network (ANN)-CA, and recursive neural network (RNN)-CA. Ultimately, we utilized LU and ES to quantitatively evaluate the ESV changes. The results indicated that: (1) The variable trend of ESV in arid area is different from that in coastal humid areas. (2) Forest land and water were the main factors that affect the ESV change. (3) The EPD scenario was more suitable for sustainable urban development. © 2021",Funding text 1: The authors are grateful to the editor and reviewers for their careful and valuable suggestions.

These models typically lack microscale variables (e.g., street level), which may improve prediction with fine-spatial gradients. We developed microscale variables of the urban environment including Point of Interest (POI) data, Google Street View (GSV) imagery, and satellite-based measures of urban form. We developed United States national models for six criteria pollutants (NO2, PM2.5, O3, CO, PM10, SO2) using various modeling approaches: Stepwise Regression + kriging (SW-K), Partial Least Squares + kriging (PLS-K), and Machine Learning + kriging (ML-K). We compared predictor variables (e.g., traditional vs microscale) and emerging modeling approaches (ML-K) to well-established approaches (i.e., traditional variables in a PLS-K or SW-K framework). We found that combined predictor variables (traditional + microscale) in the ML-K models outperformed the well-established approaches (10-fold spatial cross-validation (CV) R2 increased 0.02-0.42 [average: 0.19] among six criteria pollutants). Comparing all model types using microscale variables to models with traditional variables, the performance is similar (average difference of 10-fold spatial CV R2 = 0.05) suggesting microscale variables are a suitable substitute for traditional variables. ML-K and microscale variables show promise for improving national empirical models. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","This publication was developed as part of the Center for Clean Air Climate Solutions (CACES), which was supported under Assistance Agreement No. R835873 awarded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Due to the complex temporal and spatial correlation, it is a challenge to effectively predict traffic flow. Most of the existing traffic flow prediction methods use machine learning algorithms or deep learning models, and the methods have their own advantages and disadvantages. If the two advantages can be combined, the accuracy of traffic flow prediction will be further improved. Aiming at the traffic spatio-temporal data, a dual autoregressive component traffic prediction model based on improved Graph WaveNet is proposed. First, the three time convolution layers are effectively fused through the gated three-branch time convolution network, which further improves the ability of capture time correlation. Second, the autoregression component is introduced for the first time to effectively fuse the autoregression component with the gated three-branch time convolution network and the convolution layer, so that the model can fully reflect the linear and non-linear relationship between space-time data. Through experiments on two real public transportation data sets of METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, the proposed model is compared with other traffic flow prediction benchmark models. The results show that whether it is a short-term or longterm forecast, the model proposed in the paper is better than the benchmark model in all indicators. © 2021 Editorial office of Computer Science.

However, the coexistence of these devices could pose a real challenge - co-channel interference that would severely compromise network performances. Although the coexistence issues has been partially discussed elsewhere in some articles, there is no single review that fully summarises and compares recent research outcomes and challenges of IEEE 802.15.4 networks, Bluetooth and WLANs together. In this work, we revisit and provide a comprehensive review on the coexistence and interference mitigation for those three types of networks. We summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the current methodologies, analysis and simulation models in terms of numerous important metrics such as the packet reception ratio, latency, scalability and energy efficiency. We discover that although Bluetooth and IEEE 802.15.4 networks are both WPANs, they show quite different performances in the presence of WLANs. IEEE 802.15.4 networks are adversely impacted by WLANs, whereas WLANs are interfered by Bluetooth. When IEEE 802.15.4 networks and Bluetooth co-locate, they are unlikely to harm each other.

This selection of textile industrial zones is based on a set of criteria such as the proximity of the market, the suppliers and the logistical costs involved due to the chosen location and this in an ecosystem that must offer the most favorable conditions. Even though it is a very important decision, there are very few studies on the location selection of the textile manufacturing facility within the Moroccan context.

However, it is difficult to predict the degree of air pollution of a location by exploiting massive air pollution datasets incorporating data on spatially related locations. Construction of a spatial correlation prediction model for air pollution is therefore required for air pollution big-data mining. In this paper, we propose an air pollution-concentration spatial correlation prediction model based on a fusion deep neural network called FDN-learning. Three models are combined: a stacked anti-autoencoder network, Gaussian function model, and long short-term memory network (LSTM). The FDN-learning model is composed of three layers for feature expansion, intermediate processing, and data prediction. In the first layer, we employ a stacked anti-autoencoder model to learn the source-data spatial features through a feature expansion hidden layer; this can enrich the feature vector and mine more information for further prediction. In the second layer, the Gaussian function evaluates effective weights for the outputs of the stacked anti-autoencoder models in the preceding layer; the spatial correction effects are therefore incorporated in this layer. Finally, the LSTM model in the data prediction layer learns the air pollution-concentration temporal features. A fine-tuning method based on stochastic gradient descent is applied to the FDN-learning model for improved performance. Empirical results are used to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed model based on a real-world air pollution dataset. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Funding text 1: This work is funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 61572326 , 61802258 , 61702333 ), Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai ( 18ZR1428300 ), the Shanghai Committee of Science and Technology ( 17070502800 ).; Funding text 2: This document is the results of the research project funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 61572326 , 61802258 , 61702333 ), Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai ( 18ZR1428300 ), and the Shanghai Committee of Science and Technology ( 17070502800 ).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114265845,Yes,China,Environment,Environment & Sustainability,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Deep Neural Network (Fusion),Prediction/Forecasting,Predict urban PM2.5 spatial correlation using fusion deep neural network,"SDG 3 (Health), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 13 (Climate)",Methodological,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

New technologies improve the quality of citizens’ life. However, the use of any technology raises new issues and challenges. In a smart city, the vulnerable action of an individual or organization can put the entire city at risk. Due to the reliance of various components of smart cities on information and communication technology, cyber-security challenges (such as information leakage and malicious cyber-attacks) in this field affect smart cities behavior. Therefore, in order to respond to the enthusiastic acceptance of global smart city technologies, cyber security must develop in same direction. The aim of this paper is survey and discus on explanation of cyber security, smart cities, and survey of available relevant literature on security in that technology. For this purpose, the present study focuses on the four main components of a smart city, i.e. smart grid, Smart building, Smart transportation system, and Smart healthcare. In particular, summary of two deep learning method and cyber-security programs as well as technology correlation in smart cities are discussed. Furthermore, effective functional solutions in maintaining cyber-security and user privacy in smart cities are explained. The next progress trends of smart city with cyber security are described. Solutions need to be devised to address each of the security issues.

The rapid development of remote sensing technology allows for the identification of urban functional zones, which is important since they serve as basic spatial units for urban planning and functioning. The accuracy of three methods—kernel density estimation, term frequency-inverse document frequency, and deep learning—for detecting urban functional zones was investigated using the Gaode points of interest, high-resolution satellite images, and OpenStreetMap. Kuancheng District was divided into twenty-one functional types (five single functional types and twenty mixed ones). The results showed that an approach using deep learning had a higher accuracy than the other two methods for delineating four out of five functions (excluding the commercial function) when compared with a field survey.

Short-term passenger flow prediction is of great significance for operational safety, network optimization, and then smart city building. While the urban rail passenger flow is cyclical and random in the aspect of temporal characteristics, passenger flows in certain time slots are similar and passenger flows at adjacent stations are spatially correlated. Considering the above spatiotemporal characteristics, this research proposes a deep learning model, named k-means-ConvLSTM (k-ConvLSTM) for urban rail short-term passenger flow prediction based on the ConvLSTM and the adaptive k-means clustering algorithm. Experiments are designed to optimize the key parameters of the model. Also, in order to examine the performance of the proposed model, abundant experiments are conducted based on the real passenger flow data of the Shenzhen Metro IC card.

In this context, many demand-side management programs are being developed to achieve flexibility from different loads like space heating. As space heating models for flexibility simulations are an interdisciplinary field of work, complex civil engineering thermal models need to be combined with complex electrical engineering control simulations in different software frameworks. Traditionally used methods have shortcomings in one of those two domains as the publications that provide complex control strategies for demand response are lacking complex thermal models and vice versa. Co-simulations overcome this problem but are computationally expensive and have compatibility limitations. Thus, the aim of this work is to develop a methodology for designing space heating/cooling models, intended for positive energy district- or smart city simulations, which provide high accuracy at low computational expense. This could be achieved by synthesizing neural network object models from IDA-ICE civil engineering models in Matlab.

A heterogeneous private edge cloud system was proposed to address the requirements of these applications. The proposed heterogeneous private edge cloud system is characterized by a complex and dynamic multilayer network and computing infrastructure. Efficient management and utilization of this infrastructure may increase data rates and reduce data latency, data privacy risks, and traffic to the core Internet network. A novel intelligent middleware platform is proposed in the current study to manage and utilize heterogeneous private edge cloud infrastructure efficiently. The proposed platform aims to provide computing, data collection, and data storage services to support emerging resource-intensive and non-resource-intensive smart city and 5G network applications. It aims to leverage regression analysis and reinforcement learning methods to solve the problem of efficiently allocating heterogeneous resources to application tasks. This platform adopts parallel transmission techniques, dynamic interface allocation techniques, and machine learning-based algorithms in a dynamic multilayer network infrastructure to improve network and application performance. Moreover, it uses container and device virtualization technologies to address problems related to heterogeneous hardware and execution environments. © 2021 by the author.

Over the past 20 years, the city of Dallas, Texas, has consistently been one of the fastest growing cities in the United States and has faced rapid urbanization and great amounts of urban sprawl, leading to an increase in built-up surface area. In this study, we utilize Landsat 8 satellite images, Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies, land use/land cover (LULC) data, and a state-of-the-art methodology combining machine learning algorithms (eX-treme Gradient Boosted models, or XGBoost) and a modern game theoretic-based approach (Shap-ley Additive exPlanation, or SHAP values) to investigate how different land use/land cover classi-fications impact the land surface temperature and park cooling effects in the city of Dallas. We con-clude that green spaces, residential, and commercial/office spaces have the largest impacts on Land Surface Temperatures (LST) as well as the Park’s Cooling Intensity (PCI). Additionally, we have found that the extent and direction of influence of these categories depends heavily on the surrounding area. By using SHAP values we can describe these interactions in greater detail than pre-vious studies. These results will provide an important reference for future urban and park place-ment planning to minimize the urban heat island effect, especially in sprawling cities. © 2021 by the authors.

This research developed a new computational framework to investigate four main dimensions of vulnerability (environmental, social, economic and physical). An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Model and a SWOT-Quantitative Strategic Planning Matrix (QSPM) were applied. Firstly, a literature review was performed to explore indicators with significant impact on aforementioned dimensions of vulnerability to earthquakes. Next, the twenty identified indicators were analyzed in ArcGIS, a geographic information system (GIS) software, to map earthquake vulnerability. After classification and reclassification of the layers, standardized maps were presented as input to a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Self-Organizing Map (SOM) neural network. The resulting Earthquake Vulnerability Maps (EVMs) showed five categories of vulnerability ranging from very high, to high, moderate, low and very low. Accordingly, out of the nine municipality zones in Tabriz city, Zone one was rated as the most vulnerable to earthquakes while Zone seven was rated as the least vulnerable. Vulnerability to earthquakes of residential buildings was also identified. To validate the results data were compared between a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and a Self-Organizing Map (SOM). The scatter plots showed strong correlations between the vulnerability ratings of the different zones achieved by the SOM and MLP. Finally, the hybrid SWOT-QSPM paradigm was proposed to identify and evaluate strategies for hazard mitigation of the most vulnerable zone. For hazard mitigation in this zone we recommend to diligently account for environmental phenomena in designing and locating of sites. The findings are useful for decision makers and government authorities to reconsider current natural disaster management strategies. © 2021 by the authors.

Low access to healthy food sources influences people’s diet and activity habits. Guilford County in North Carolina has a high ranking in low food security and a high rate of health issues such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and obesity. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to investigate the geospatial correlation between health issues and food access areas. The secondary objective was to quantitatively compare food access areas and heath issues’ descriptive statistics. The tertiary objective was to compare several machine learning techniques and find the best model that fit health issues against various food access variables with the highest performance accuracy. In this study, we adopted a food-access perspective to show that communities that have residents who have equitable access to healthy food options are typically less vulnerable to health-related disasters. We propose a methodology to help policymakers lower the number of health issues in Guilford County by analyzing such issues via correlation with respect to food access. Specifically, we conducted a geographic information system mapping methodology to examine how access to healthy food options influenced health and mortality outcomes in one of the largest counties in the state of North Carolina. We created geospatial maps representing food deserts—areas with scarce access to nutritious food; food swamps—areas with more availability of unhealthy food options compared to healthy food options; and food oases—areas with a relatively higher availability of healthy food options than unhealthy options. Our results presented a positive correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.819 among obesity and the independent variables of transportation access, and population. The correlation coefficient matrix analysis helped to identify a strong negative correlation between obesity and median income. Overall, this study offers valuable insights that can help health authorities develop preemptive preparedness for healthcare disasters. © 2021 by the authors.

With the growing demand for Smart Applications, it becomes clear that IoT will bring regular automation and intelligent sensing to a new level thus improving quality of life. The core component of the IoT ecosystem is data which exists in various forms and formats. The collected data is then later used to create context awareness and make meaningful decisions. Besides an undoubtedly large number of advantages from the usage of IoT, there exist numerous challenges attributed to the security of objects that cannot be neglected for uninterrupted services. The Mirai botnet attack demonstrated that the IoT system is susceptible to different forms of cyberattacks. While advanced data analytics and Machine Learning have proved efficiency in various applications of cybersecurity, those still have not been explored enough in the literature from the applicability perspective in the domain of resource-constrained IoT. Several architectures and frameworks have been proposed for defining the ways for analyzing the data, yet mostly investigating off-chip analysis. In this contribution, we show how an Artificial Neural Network model can be trained and deployed on trivial IoT nodes for detecting intelligent similarity-based network attacks. This article proposes a concept of the resource-constrained intelligent system as a part of the IoT infrastructure to be able to harden the cybersecurity on microcontrollers.

Recent deep learning-based LCZ classification studies have adopted a scene classification approach with computer vision-inspired models. In light of these advancements, this study introduces a multi-scale, multi-level attention network (MSMLA-Net) for deep learning-based LCZ classification. MSMLA-Net integrates a multi-scale (MS) module to generate multi-scale features from the input data and a novel multi-level attention (MLA) module as a branch unit from the model's main ResNet backbone. MLA uses the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) at multiple stages to generate multi-level spatially and spectrally enhanced features for context aggregation. This study presents comprehensive model-based experiments on model depth, the individual and combined influence of MS and MLA modules, and the addition of attention mechanisms. Furthermore, data-based experiments are conducted to determine optimal Sentinel-2 spectral bands, while OpenStreetMap (OSM) building data, ALOS World 3D DSM height information, and a national land cover map are included as ancillary bands. LCZ classification tests are conducted on six major cities in South Korea. With regards to model-based performance, MSMLA-Net was built using a modified SE-ResNet50 backbone (MSMLA-50) and obtained the best classification results using 48 by 48-pixel input patches with a combination of all Sentinel-2 and ancillary bands, outperforming three state-of-the-art LCZ classification models. In particular, only MSMLA-50 reached over 70% built-up overall accuracy and maintained high accuracy even when tested on completely unseen areas in a “citywise” leave-one-out sampling strategy. For data-based results, the combination of Sentinel-2 Red Edge bands were helpful, mainly due to the greater number of available bands. Training only ancillary data generated up to 75.0% for built-up overall accuracy, albeit at the cost of low natural overall accuracy. Using all available bands and ancillary data produced the best results, but a combination of only OSM and Sentinel-2 bands also generated comparable accuracy. Ultimately, the proposed MSMLA-Net bridges advanced computer vision techniques such as attention mechanisms and multi-level context aggregation to improve LCZ classification. The MS and MLA modules can be applied on different backbones, sophisticated sampling schemes, and data inputs to flexibly achieve improved classification results. © 2021","This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2019R1I1A2A01058144).

The proposed categorization method assesses urban space broadly on two dimensions—the states of urbanization and the architectural form of the units observed. This paper shows how the sixteen sub-categories can be used by state-of-the-art deep learning modules (fully convolutional network FCN-8, U-Net, and DeepLabv3+) to categorize formal and informal urban areas in seven urban cities in the developing world—-Dhaka, Nairobi, Jakarta, Guangzhou, Mumbai, Cairo, and Lima. Firstly, an expert visually annotated and categorized 50 × 50 km Google Earth images of the cities. Each urban space was divided into four socioeconomic categories: (1) highly informal area; (2) moderately informal area; (3) moderately formal area, and (4) highly formal area. Then, three models mentioned above were used to categorize urban spaces. Image encompassing 70% of the urban space was used to train the models, and the remaining 30% was used for testing and validation of each city. The DeepLabv3+ model can segment the test part with an average accuracy of 90.0% for Dhaka, 91.5% for Nairobi, 94.75% for Jakarta, 82.0% for Guangzhou city, 94.25% for Mumbai, 91.75% for Cairo, and 96.75% for Lima. These results are the best for the DeepLabv3+ model among all. Thus, DeepLabv3+ shows an overall high accuracy level for most of the measuring parameters for all cities, making it highly scalable, readily usable to understand the cities’ current conditions, forecast land use growth, and other computational modeling tasks. Therefore, the proposed categorization method is also suited for real-time socioeconomic comparative analysis among cities, making it an essential tool for the policymakers to plan future sustainable urban spaces. © 2021 by the authors.

Organizations often start by exploring the potential with a proof-of-concept and a pilot project, with the process later grinding to a halt for various reasons. Pilot purgatory, in which organizations invest in small-scale implementations without them realizing substantial benefits, is given very little attention in the scientific literature relating to the question of why AI and IoT initiatives fail to scale up for smart cities. By combining extensive study of the literature and expert interviews, this research explores the underlying reasons why many smart city initiatives relying on Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) fail to scale up. The findings suggest that a multitude of factors may leave organizations ill prepared for smart city AIoT solutions, and that these tend to multiply when cities lack much-needed resources and capabilities. Yet many organizations tend to overlook the fact that such initiatives require them to pay attention to all aspects of change: strategy, data, people and organization, process, and technology. Furthermore, the research reveals that some factors tend to be more influential in certain stages. Strategic factors tend to be more prominent in the earlier stages, whereas factors relating to people and the organization tend to feature later when organizations roll out solutions. The study also puts forward potential strategies that companies can employ to scale up successfully. Three main strategic themes emerge from the study: proof-of-value, rather than proof-of-concept; treating and managing data as a key asset; and commitment at all levels. © 2021 by the authors.

In the big data era, multisourced data are collected on a daily basis, whereas a large part of the data may be irrelevant, redundant, noisy, or even malicious from a machine learning perspective. Feature selection has been a powerful data cleaning technique to reduce data redundancy and improve system performance in machine learning. Inspired by reinforcement learning that learns from its experience, in this article, we propose a novel efficient deep $Q$ -network (DQN)-based feature selection method for multisourced data cleaning. In particular, we model the feature selection problem as a competition between an agent and the environment in dynamic states, which is solved by a DQN. Traditional DQN suffers from high computational complexity and requires a significant amount of time in order to converge in the training process. To tackle these challenges, we develop a space searching algorithm called SS to speed up the training process of the DQN agent. To validate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on various types of IoT data. Simulation results show that the proposed DQN-based feature selection algorithms achieve much better performance compared with state-of-the-art methods, and are robust under data poisoning attacks. © 2014 IEEE.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118393267,Yes,United States,Infrastructure,Smart City Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Deep Q-Network (Reinforcement Learning),Classification,Select features for multisourced IoT data cleaning using Deep Q-Network,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Methodological,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

In these applications, sensors such as smart phone cameras, web cameras or CCTV cameras are used for detecting and tracking physical activities of users. Inevitably, spoof detection in HAR is essential to prevent anomalies and false alarms. To this end, we propose a deep learning based approach that can be used to detect spoofing in various fields such as border control, institutional security and public safety by surveillance cameras. Specifically, in this work, we address the problem of detecting spoofing occurring from video replay attacks, which is more common in such applications. We present a new database containing several videos of users juggling a football, captured under different lighting conditions and using different display and capture devices. We train our models using this database and the proposed system is capable of running in parallel with the HAR algorithms in real-time. Our experimental results show that our approach precisely detects video replay spoofing attacks and generalizes well, even to other applications such as spoof detection in face biometric authentication. Results show that our approach is effective even under resizing and compression artifacts that are common in HAR applications using remote server connections. © 2021 by the authors.

Scientists and environmental organizations have been looking for new ways to combat and control the air pollution, developing new solutions as technologies evolves. In the last decade, devices able to observe and maintain pollution levels have become more accessible and less expensive, and with the appearance of the Internet of Things (IoT), new approaches for combating pollution were born.

Recent advances in remote sensing and machine learning technologies have contributed to the mapping and monitoring of multi-scale urban land uses, yet there lacks a holistic mapping framework that is compatible with different end users’ demands. Moreover, land use mix has evolved to be a key component in modern urban settings, but few have explicitly measured the spatial complexity of land use or quantitively uncovered its driving forces. Addressing these challenges, here we developed a novel two-stage bottom-up scheme for mapping essential urban land use categories. In the first stage, we conducted object-based land use classification using crowdsourcing features derived from multi-source open big data and an automated ensemble learning approach. In the second stage, we identified parcel-based land use attributes, including the dominant type and mixture mode, by spatially correlating land parcels with the object-based results. Furthermore, we investigated the potential influencing factors of land use mix using principal components analysis and multiple linear regression. Experimental results in Ningbo, a coastal city in China, showed that the proposed framework could accurately depict the distribution and composition of urban land uses. At the object scale, the highest classification accuracy was as high as 86% and 78% for the major (Level I) and minor (Level II) categories, respectively. At the parcel scale, the generated land use maps were spatially consistent with the object-based maps. We found larger parcels were more likely to be mixed in land use, and industrial lands were characterized as the most complicated category. We also identified multiple factors that had a collective impact on land use mix, including geography, socioeconomy, accessibility, and landscape metrics. Altogether, our proposed framework offered an alternative to investigating urban land use composition, which could be applied in a broad range of implications in future urban studies. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, we extracted the built-up regions of 14 central cities in the Hunan province using the DMSP‐OLS night light remote sensing datasets from 1992 to 2018, and evaluated the spatial and temporal characteristics of the built‐up regions in terms of the area, expansion speed, and main expansion direction. The backpropagation (BP) neural network and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model were used to predict the area of the built‐up regions from 2019 to 2026. The model predictions were based on the GDP, ratio of the secondary industry output to the GDP, ratio of the tertiary industry output to the GDP, year‐end urban population, and urban road area. The results demonstrated that the built‐up area and expansion speed of the central cities in the eastern part of the Hunan province were significantly higher than those in the western part. The main expansion directions of the 14 central cities were east and south. The urban road area, year‐end urban population, and GDP were the main driving factors of the expansion. The urban expansion model based on the BP neural network provided a high prediction accuracy (R = 0.966). It was estimated that the total area of urban built‐up regions in the Hunan province will reach 2463.80 km2 by 2026. These findings provide a new perspective for predicting urban areas rapidly and simply, and it also provides a useful reference for studying the spatial expansion characteristics of central cities and formulating a sustainable urban development strategy during the 14th Five‐Year Plan of China. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, Land Surface Temperature (LST) from Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellites is used to investigate the contribution of potential factors that generate the SUHI phenomenon. We employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) techniques to model the main temporal and spatial SUHI patterns of Cartago, Colombia, for the period 2001–2020. We test and evaluate the performance of three different emissivity models to retrieve LST.

Our SUHI model reveals that the factors with the highest impact are the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and the Normalized Difference Build-up Index (NDBI). Furthermore, we incorporate a weighted Naïve Bayes Machine Learning (NBML) algorithm to identify areas prone to extreme temperatures that can be used to define and apply normative actions to mitigate the negative consequences of SUHI.

The successful launch of a high resolution (130 m) nighttime remote sensing satellite, Luojia 1-01, provides great potential in the study of urban issues. This study attempted to extract city roads using a Luojia 1-01 nighttime lighting image. The urban regions were firstly distinguished through a threshold method. Then, an unsupervised PCNN (pulse coupled neural network) was established to extract the road networks in urban regions. A series of optimizing methods was proposed to enhance the image contrast and eliminate the residential regions along the roads. The final extraction results after optimizing were compared with OSM (OpenStreetMap) data, showing the high precision of the proposed approach with the accuracy rate reaching 83.2%. We also found the precision of city centers to be lower than suburban regions due to the influence of intensive human activities. Our study confirms the potential of Luojia 1-01 data in the extraction of city roads and provides new thought for more complex and microscopic study of city issues. © 2021 by the authors.

Road network and building extractions are some of the main tasks necessary for emergency management, smart transport, and smart city systems. Currently, most researchers are focusing on deep learning and machine learning methods to classify high-resolution images. Machine learning algorithms have become important tools in modern hyperspectral image analyses. Hyperspectral images cover a variety of spectral bands with rather finite intervals in the electromagnetic spectrum and high spectral data resolutions. It is important to use high-resolution imagery to extract these features. The main objective of this research is to create a current technique for dimensionality reductions, automated building extractions, and road detections obtained from hyperspectral images. Given the above issues, this paper proposes a new dimensionality reduction and classification technique by combining the ICA, PCA, FCN, and SVM classification models. This new model extracts and classifies road and building features from hyperspectral imagery with the highest accuracy.

Past studies developed several LULC change models to identify the factors behind the changes and to simulate future LULC scenarios. However, the accuracy of these models remained contentious and a matter of ongoing debate and research. Most of these studies used a training dataset to train the model and a validation dataset to validate the prediction accuracy, both of which are a part of the original training dataset. However, to evaluate the model's actual predictive capability in terms of spatial data modeling, it is necessary to test the model's performance on the real-world dataset. In this study, we presented an XGBoost model aiming at improving the prediction accuracy while used a separate test dataset to test the model's actual predictive capacity. We applied the method to predict the land cover change of the Khulna City Corporation (KCC) area in Bangladesh. The study reveals that the KCC area experienced rapid urban development during the 2002–2018 period while the agricultural and vacant land declined at a similar rate. The major factors contributing to this substantial change of the city's land covers are-proximity to existing built-up areas and proximity to major roads. Our study indicates that agricultural areas and wetlands closer to the major roads and existing urban areas have a greater probability of converting into built-up areas. Our experiment demonstrates that the XGBoost model can predict the city's land cover change with greater accuracy and outperforms the benchmark models such as the LR-CA and ANN-CA. The finding assures the reliability of the XGBoost model while predicting future land-cover scenarios. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85117166001,Yes,Bangladesh,Land Use,Urban Planning & Land Use,Urban Development & Land Use,Machine Learning,Prediction/Forecasting,Model urban land cover change using data-driven machine learning in Khulna City,"SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 15 (Land)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

Existing indoor localization approaches mostly rely on fingerprint techniques, leveraging either spatially discrete fingerprints or temporally consecutive ones for localization. However, these approaches often suffer from large errors or high time overhead in practice due to signal ambiguities or long input sequences. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes a framework utilizing multiple adaptive representations of signal sequences for localization, where each representation indicates a corresponding signal structure with underlying location clues. As an example, the proposed approach takes geomagnetic signal sequences as input and infers location features from two intuitive representations, e.g., spatial and temporal ones. With adaptive signal representations, the proposed approach takes specifically optimized neural networks to extract corresponding location clues respectively and fuses them to generate more distinguishing features for more accurate localization. Furthermore, the ensemble learning mechanism is adopted in the approach and a weighted k-NN based location estimation algorithm is devised to enhance the robustness. Extensive experiments in three different trial sites demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art competing schemes by a wide margin, reducing mean localization error by more than 46%. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

They tend to explore only the association established between a single factor and the distribution of crime. In order to more accurately and quickly visualize and predict crime distribution in different neighborhoods, and to provide a basis for security planning and design by planning designers, this paper uses GAN neural networks to build a prediction model of city floor plans and corresponding crime distribution maps. We take Philadelphia as the research sample, use more than 2 million crime information of Philadelphia from 2006 to 2018 to draw the crime hotspot distribution map, and collect the corresponding map of Philadelphia, and train the model for predicting the crime rate of the city with more than two thousand sets of one-to-one corresponding images as the training set. When the training is complete, a floor plan can be fed directly to the model, and the model will immediately feed back a hotspot map reflecting the crime distribution. Using the untrained Philadelphia data as the test set, the model can accurately predict crime concentration areas and the predicted crime concentration areas are similar to the concentration areas considered in previous studies. With the feedback from the model, the city layout can be adjusted and the crime rate can be greatly reduced when the simulated city planner tunes into the city plan.

The land use patterns in mining areas change rapidly for natural and anthropogenic reasons. Land-use/land-cover (LU/LC) change is extremely important in the sustainable development of mining cities. Large-scale opencast coal mining results in the destruction of built-up land, industrial land and mining land as well as arable land resources. Therefore, the analysis of changes in mineral resources and arable land use has attracted increasing attention. With the development of remote sensing (RS) and deep learning (DL) technology, many forms of data for detecting land-use changes are available. The goal of this paper is to promote coordinated land-use development. In this study, an ensemble feature pyramid convolutional neural network model (EFPCNNM) approach, which combines the theory of convolutional neural network (CNN), feature pyramid (FP) and ensemble learning (EL), was used to analyze land-use change in the Longmen Mountain opencast coal mine area in Anqing City, Huaining County, Anhui Province, China. Unlike the CNN, and ensemble convolutional neural network model (ECNNM), which only used the high-level features to predict the ground objects, and the feature information of other layers was not fully considered, EFPCNNM enhanced the small target information in high-level features and improved the detection performance of significant ground object. EFPCNNM was highly portable and could be embedded in many models to further boost performance. Comparative experiments on support vector machine (SVM), extreme learning machine (ELM), artificial neural network (ANN), CNN and ECNNM methods demonstrated that the EFPCNNM could exceed the other models in terms of detection accuracy and inference speed, e.g., the overall accuracy was 93.5036%, kappa coefficient was 0.9423, and time was 2.7569 s. Multitemporal RS images from eight periods starting in 2005 and ending in 2019 were used as the land-use data. With a typical classification system and RS quantitative analysis, this paper also evaluated the temporal and spatial changes in arable land use in the mining area. Of all the land-use types, the area of arable land decreased the most over the study period, and the area of mining land and construction land increased the most. In addition, changes in the seepage area associated with collapse sites in the study area were analyzed. The results of this change detection process could provide decision support for the coordinated development of land use and mineral resources in mining areas. © 2021, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.",This work was supported in part by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFC0401908).

Much research involves site visits or conventional geospatial approaches, and few studies have leveraged street view imagery (SVI) for conducting virtual audits. These have assessed a limited range of aspects, and not all have been automated using computer vision (CV). Furthermore, studies have not yet zeroed in on gauging the usability of these technologies thoroughly. We investigate, with experiments at a fine spatial scale and across multiple geographies (Singapore and Tokyo), whether we can use SVI and CV to assess bikeability comprehensively. Extending related work, we develop an exhaustive index of bikeability composed of 34 indicators. The results suggest that SVI and CV are adequate to evaluate bikeability in cities comprehensively. As they outperformed non-SVI counterparts by a wide margin, SVI indicators are also found to be superior in assessing urban bikeability and potentially can be used independently, replacing traditional techniques. However, the paper exposes some limitations, suggesting that the best way forward is combining both SVI and non-SVI approaches. The new bikeability index presents a contribution in transportation and urban analytics, and it is scalable to assess cycling appeal widely. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Funding text 1: We appreciate the comments by Jeffrey Ho and the design contribution by April Zhu (National University of Singapore).

The results show that REBEB, a new backoff algorithm, is similar to the binary exponential backoff algorithm in terms of throughput performance. REBEB focuses more on fairness, which is up to 0.985, and to a certain extent, its security is significantly improved. The fairness of REBEB algorithm is more than 0.4 in different nodes and competing windows, and the fairness of the system is better when the number of nodes is small. To sum up, the IoT system based on LoRa communication can effectively improve the security performance of the system in the construction of smart city and avoid the security threats in the IoT signal transmission. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61902203) and Key Research and Development Plan—Major Scientific and Technological Innovation Projects of ShanDong Province (2019JZZY020101).

As the dimensions and complexity of the IoT communications between intelligent devices, industrial equipment, sensors, and mobile applications are continuously increasing, supporting Service Level Agreements (SLA) for a large amount of cloud data centers and a huge number of user requests is going to be more challenging. This challenge would be more complicated when the energy consumption of the industrial IoT ecosystems increases exponentially as well. Therefore, DSS models are required for automated decision-making in critical IoT environments like intelligent industrial systems and smart cities. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the DSS strategies for energy-efficient IoT applications in intelligent urban computing. The main objective of this review is (1) presenting a technical taxonomy to categorize existing energy-efficient DSS models for industrial and smart environments in IoT ecosystems; (2) recognizing significant research trends in the field of energy-aware DSS strategies for intelligent urban computing in IoT and (3) presenting a technical and statistical analysis of reviewed studies and evaluation factors.

Understanding the interaction between human emotions and the built environment is therefore essential for developing strategies towards a psychologically friendly and socially resilient environment. This study aims to model the pedestrian emotion in high-density urban areas of Hong Kong using machine learning based on environmental visual exposure, which is one of the most significant factors affecting emotions. Using ambulatory sensing and portable technologies, two-dimensional emotional data from 99 pedestrians are retrieved from coupled data with respect to wearable arousal, subjective report preference, and the location at a high spatiotemporal resolution (4 m). The visual environment is quantified by isovist and street view factors. This study examines the impact of visual exposures using two multiple linear regression (MLR) models and establishes a predictive model using random forest (RF) (N = 548). The MLR models have R2 values around 0.5 and suggest that in the high-density environment, exposure to more trees, visual volume, and drift magnitude can cause positive emotions. Conversely, areas with a view of sign symbols, object proportion, min-radial, and occlusivity can cause negative emotions. The resultant predictive model with nine visual exposure variables can explain 79% of the spatial variance of pedestrian emotion. Furthermore, the methodological framework provides opportunities for spatial, data-driven approaches to portable sensing and urban planning research. The findings are also applicable to optimize the infrastructure design of outdoor environments for more psychologically friendly experiences. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Funding text 1: The study is supported by a PGS studentship from The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

Due to the impact of urbanization, the we face hasty climatic change. To mitigate the urban heat island in the developed and developing cities, a very accurate land cover classification has to be developed. Through which we can identify the changes in build-up areas, water bodies and vegetation index. In this paper, a hybrid hot encoding VGG19 deep learning method has been proposed. And a transfer learning method has been used to transfer the training data trained by the RestNet50 method to the proposed HGVGG19 method. The satellite images and aerial images are collected from various sources and classified based on the features. And the image dataset has been pre-processed using the image augmentation technique. Through which the image has been resized and processed for training it with the proposed mode. The categorical data cannot be processed directly, so we use one hot encoding method to find the borders of the class. Then the data has been trained using VGG19 method. Then using the MLR classifier we classify the images and using decision tree the class prediction has been predicted. After testing the model an accuracy of 98.5% has been achieved. Using the proposed algorithm, the analysis has been made with the historical images of many regions. And eight different class values have been obtained and stored as the textual data.

The methods developed up to now measure urban morphology with numerical indices describing density, proportion, and mixture, but they do not directly represent morphological features from the human's visual and intuitive perspective. We take the first step to bridge the gap by proposing a deep learning-based technique to automatically classify road networks into four classes on a visual basis. The method is implemented by generating an image of the street network (Colored Road Hierarchy Diagram), which we introduce in this paper, and classifying it using a deep convolutional neural network (ResNet-34). The model achieves an overall classification accuracy of 0.875. Nine cities around the world are selected as the study areas with their road networks acquired from OpenStreetMap. Latent subgroups among the cities are uncovered through clustering on the percentage of each road network category. In the subsequent part of the paper, we focus on the usability of such classification: we apply our method in a case study of urban vitality prediction. An advanced tree-based regression model (LightGBM) is for the first time designated to establish the relationship between morphological indices and vitality indicators. The effect of road network classification is found to be small but positively associated with urban vitality. This work expands the toolkit of quantitative urban morphology study with new techniques, supporting further studies in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","We gratefully acknowledge the data sources and the open-source packages used in this study.

Accordingly, this study focuses on the city logistics problem with respect to policy decisions regarding the use of light commercial vehicles through urban consolidation schemes in a way to minimise carbon emissions and, thus, total transportation costs. In particular, this study has developed a mathematical model to minimise total transportation costs including routing costs, vehicle fixed costs, emission costs, and zone entry fees. The proposed model is solved using a modified ant colony optimisation (MACO) technique. The optimal results are obtained within CPU time, and results are validated using the ACO algorithm and the Cplex solver. Meanwhile, different supporting policies are introduced, and computational experiments are executed on a real-life case study.

Though previous studies have examined the effects of various urban features on how much children play and where they play, such studies rely on quantitative measurements of play such as the precise location of play and the duration of play time, while people's subjective feelings regarding the playability of their environment are overlooked. In this study, we capture people's perception of place playability by employing Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to classify street view images. A deep learning model trained on the labelled data is then used to evaluate neighborhood playability for three U.S. cities: Boston, Seattle, and San Francisco. Finally, multivariate and geographically weighted regression models are used to explore how various urban features are associated with playability. We find that higher traffic speeds and crime rates are negatively associated with playability, while higher scores for perception of beauty are positively associated with playability. Interestingly, a place that is perceived as lively may not be playable.

Previous studies have proposed various data-driven methods to investigate the relationship between building energy consumption and hundreds of potential influencing features. However, it is difficult to include all potential features in one single model since either some data could be unavailable or the model would be too complex. To identify the critical features, this study develops a data-driven random forest (RF) based framework with a dataset of Taipei City, consisting of 24,764 buildings in 881 city-blocks, to model the relationship between city-block-level building-oriented features and building energy consumption. The RF model is found to outperform other machine learning models including logistic regression, k-nearest neighborhood, support vector machine, and decision tree models in the predictive accuracy of the classification problem. Seven critical features related to the built year of buildings, building gross floor area, building density, and the ratio of commercial buildings in the block are identified from the 59 city-block-level building-oriented features. The developed framework could refine the features adopted in regional building energy models, and policymakers and city planners would get practical implications from the identified critical features. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support for this research by the Guangdong Science and Technology Department (GDSTC) under Grant No. 2019A1515010657.

With an introduction to the sustainable development goals, the smart city concept presents a novel idea for providing energy in a city with the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), renewable energy, such as Photovoltaic (PV) technologies, and Transformational Participation (TP) based on motivational programs for citizens. This study aims to evaluate the electrical energy consumption in Mashhad, Iran, based on machine learning tools and present the dynamic strategies for promoting citizens’ willingness for renewable energy generation based on the experts’ knowledge. The main novelty of this research is simultaneous application of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and statistical analysis for creating a Decision Support System (DSS). Then, the solar energy potential is appraised by the PV system simulation tool during one year in our case study in Mashhad, Iran. Furthermore, a Classical Delphi (CD) method is applied for motivational strategies and further TP implementation. In particular, the motivational strategies are suggested by 45 experts and then are prioritized in sequential expert meetings. The outcomes of this research indicate that the ANN model can successfully forecast the electrical energy consumption in summer and winter periods with a 99% accuracy. Then, based on the solar energy computations in the PV system, the peak of electrical energy consumption can be controlled in the hottest and coldest months. Last but not least, the superposition of experts’ and citizens’ opinions reveal A4 (sharing benefits of optimized costs with the citizens by solar energy generation), B2 (reducing the electrical energy cost for solar energy generation, especially in peak times) and C1 (creating the energy coin in the city with credits instead of spending money in urban activities fits to solar energy generation) as the main motivational strategies for solar energy generation in short, middle and long-term planning horizons. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","This work is supported in part by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 52075303 and 51775238 , and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Central South University under Grant No. 2019GN048 .",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85110520943,Yes,Iran,Energy,Smart Grid & Energy,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,"Neural Network, Delphi",Prediction/Forecasting,Implement solar energy in smart cities using ANN and photovoltaic technologies,"SDG 7 (Energy), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Longitudinal,Strong

The world economic market is experiencing a big shift and the share market has observed crashes day-by-day. Even, the Indian economy has witnessed a slowdown in the current pandemic, and recovery of it is quite difficult. The restrictions and restrain strategies (e.g., lockdown and social distancing) introduced by the government leave many professions and facilities in a dormant state, catalyzing economy downfall. It necessitates to improve economy along with control strategies of COVID-19, which is a challenging task. To handle the above-mentioned issues, this article proposes a novel economy-boosting scheme, i.e., $\xi $ boost, which is a fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics (BDA) integrated with the Internet-of-Things (IoT)-based data communication. Here, a bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) model is anticipated for early prediction of total positive cases as well as the economy. Then, it calculates an optimal subsegment of days, in which trade and commerce related restrictions could be reduced to control a sharp decline in the economy. Next, a spark-based pre and post unlock (PPU) analytics is carried out on the rise of COVID-19 cases to validate the intensity of testing in the country and deciding economy-boosting activities.

However, mapping urban RLPs at a fine scale remains challenging, due to the complex nonlinear relationship between RLPs and their potential determinants. This study developed a grid-level urban RLP mapping method based on big geo-data and ensemble learning technology to meet the needs of rapid and accurate monitoring of urban RLP dynamics. Using ensemble learning technology, combined with predictor variables extracted from points of interest (POIs) and NPP-VIIRS nighttime light images, the fine-scale RLPs in Wuhan City in 2018 were mapped through the following steps. First, the kernel density of POIs and the intensity of nighttime lights were extracted and aggregated at the 500 m × 500 m grid level as the predictor variables of RLPs. Second, several RLP prediction models were established using four individual machine learning algorithms (MLAs) and bagging and stacking ensemble methods. Finally, the prediction accuracy or errors of different models were evaluated and compared, and the best performing model was selected to estimate the RLPs of the grids with no observations in Wuhan City. The results show that: 1) Among all the individual MLAs, the support vector regression (SVR) algorithm has the best prediction performance, followed by the k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and back propagation neural network (BP-NN) algorithms. 2) In terms of improving the prediction accuracy of individual MLAs, the performance of the stacking method is better than that of the bagging method. The stacking #1 model that integrates the SVR and k-NN algorithms has the smallest prediction error, with % MAE of 8.29%, and R2 of 0.814. 3) The RLP map generated by the proposed methodological framework can effectively reveal the circular characteristics and local singularity of the RLP distribution. This study provides new ideas, methods, and technical means for rapidly and accurately mapping urban RLPs, which is conducive to the improvement of urban RLP monitoring systems in the era of big data. © 2021, Editorial office of PROGRESS IN GEOGRAPHY.

The state of mind includes perceptions about governance of autonomous vehicles' artificial intelligence (AVAI) and thus has an impact on a person's willingness to adopt and use AVs. However, one determinant of whether AVAI should be driven by society's ethics or the driver's morals, a “state of mind” variable, has not been studied. We asked 1,473 student, staff, and employee respondents at a university campus whether they prefer an AVAI learn their owners own personal morals (one's own principles) or adopt societal ethics (codes of conduct provided by an external source). Respondents were almost evenly split between whether AVAI should rely on ethics (45.6%) or morals (54.4%). Personal morals and societal ethics are not necessarily distinct and different. Sometimes both overlap and discrepancies are settled in court. However, with an AVAI these decision algorithms must be preprogrammed and the fundamental difference thus is whether an AI should learn from the individual driver (this is the status quo on how we drive today) or from society incorporating millions of drivers' choices. Both are bounded by law. Regardless, to successfully govern artificial intelligence in cities, policy-makers must thus bridge the deep divide between individuals who choose morals over ethics and vice versa. © © 2021 Kassens-Noor, Siegel and Decaminada.",This work was supported by the Center of Business and Social Analytics at Michigan State University.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123173092,Yes,United States,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,AI (General),Not Specified,Study ethics versus morals as determinant to embrace AI in future urban mobility,SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities),Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Weak

It aims at predicting the inflow (the traffic of crowds entering a region in a given time interval) and outflow (the traffic of crowds leaving a region for other places) of each region in the city with knowing the historical flow data. In this article, we propose DeepSTN+, a deep learning-based convolutional model, to predict crowd flows in the metropolis. First, DeepSTN+ employs the ConvPlus structure to model the long-range spatial dependence among crowd flows in different regions. Further, PoI distributions and time factor are combined to express the effect of location attributes to introduce prior knowledge of the crowd movements. Finally, we propose a temporal attention-based fusion mechanism to stabilize the training process, which further improves the performance. Extensive experimental results based on four real-life datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model, i.e., DeepSTN+ reduces the error of the crowd flow prediction by approximately 10%-21% compared with the state-of-the-art baselines. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.","This work was supported in part by The National Key Research and Development Program of China under grant SQ2018YFB180012, the National Nature Science Foundation of China under 61971267, 61972223, 61861136003, and 61621091, Beijing Natural Science Foundation under L182038, Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology under 20031887521, and research fund of Tsinghua University - Tencent Joint Laboratory for Internet Innovation Technology.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85138042004,Yes,China,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,Deep Learning (CNN),Prediction/Forecasting,Predict citywide crowd flow using context-aware spatial-temporal neural network,SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities),Methodological,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

During the exploration and progression of knowledge from the 15th to 18th centuries, there was no established boundaries for disciplines, and scholars made simultaneous contributions in many knowledge domains. With the evolution of the first two industrial revolutions, a growth of specialization in engineering field of expertise began emerging in the 19th century. The second half of the 20th century saw the rise of the silos in engineering due to the requirement of disciplinary specializations. Advanced technologies such as personal computers and internet served as a major catalyst in accelerated growth in depth and breadth of knowledge in respective engineering discipline during the third industrial revolution. From a pedagogical perspective, two distinct types of interdisciplinary approaches are identified: 1) evolution of hybrid fields combining two or more existing fields, and 2) bolstering of existing fields with infusion of technological knowledge. Inclusion of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, Internet-of-Things, and robotics will also be discussed. Examples such as smart cities, smart manufacturing, and innovations in the medical and health sectors will be used to demonstrate pedagogical approaches.

Deep learning algorithms are commonly used to reliably predict potential energy usage since they can overcome the issue of dependency on long-distance data in energy forecasting relative to the standard regression model. However, there are still two problems to be solved for energy forecasting, including the encoding of categorical characteristics and adaptive extraction of the most relevant characteristics for the use in predictions. To address the problems, we proposed a sequential forecasting model for medium- and long-term energy demand forecasting based on an embedding mechanism and a two-stage attention-based long-term memory neural network. An empirical study was conducted on three years of daily electricity consumption data from the residential buildings of the Pudong district of Shanghai to evaluate the model. The results show that the model can effectively extract the key features that are highly correlated with energy consumption dynamics by employing long-term dependencies in time series. In addition, the hybrid model outperforms others in terms of long-term forecasting capability.

Recently, the IoT has become popular because of its smart architectures and various applications. Among these applications, intelligent urban surveillance systems for smart cities are becoming more and more important. Therefore, designing a robust visual tracking method has become an urgent task. Deep Siamese convolutional neural networks have been applied to visual tracking recently because of their advantageous abilities to learn a matching function between the template and the target candidate. Unlike traditional Siamese networks, which separately treat the two branches, we propose deep Siamese cross-residual learning to entangle the two branches from the beginning to the end of the Siamese network. This strategy can make the two branches exchange instance-specific information at different nodes of the network and learn a more compact representation of the target. In addition, we propose a combined loss function, which consists of two complementary tasks. One task is to learn a matching function directly and the other one is to learn a classification function. Moreover, our model does not need to load any pretrained weights and is trained with limited sequences from scratch. Plenty of experiments show that our tracker performs favorably against many state-of-the-art tracking methods. © 2014 IEEE.",This work was supported in part by the Key Laboratory Foundation under Grant TCGZ2020C004.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85098774113,Yes,China,Safety/Crime,Security & Safety,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Deep Siamese CNN,Object Detection,Develop deep Siamese cross-residual learning for robust visual tracking in smart city surveillance,"SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 16 (Governance)",Methodological,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

One of the most severe consequences of this phenomenon is Groundwater Flooding (GF), with serious impacts for the human and natural environment. In Europe, GF has recently received specific attention with Directive 2007/60/EC, which requires Member States to map GF hazard and propose measures for risk mitigation. In this paper a methodology has been developed for Groundwater Flooding Susceptibility (GFS) assessment, using for the first time Spatial Distribution Models. These Machine Learning techniques connect occurrence data to predisposing factors (PFs) to estimate their distributions. The implemented methodology employs aquifer type, depth of piezometric level, thickness and hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated zone, drainage density and land-use as PFs, and a GF observations inventory as occurrences. The algorithms adopted to perform the analysis are Generalized Boosting Model, Artificial Neural Network and Maximum Entropy. Ensemble Models are carried out to reduce the uncertainty associated with each algorithm and increase its reliability. GFS is mapped by choosing the ensemble model with the best predictivity performance and dividing occurrence probability values into five classes, from very low to very high susceptibility, using Natural Breaks classification. The methodology has been tested and statistically validated in an area of 14,3 km2 located in the Metropolitan City of Naples (Italy), affected by GWLr since 1990 and GF in buildings and agricultural soils since 2007. The results of modeling show that about 93% of the inventoried points fall in the high and very high GFS classes, and piezometric level depth, thickness of unsaturated zone and drainage density are the most influencing PFs, in accordance with field observations and the triggering mechanism of GF. The outcomes provide a first step in the assessment of GF hazard and a decision support tool to local authorities for GF risk management. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Funding text 1: The Authors wish to thank the technical Department of the municipalities of Casalnuovo di Napoli and Volla, for the technical support during the research program.

Real-time assessment on individuals’ environmental affective experience can improve the scientism in measuring the quality of outdoor environments. Existing measurement methods are often insufficient for the cases of a larger site area or sample size. The machine visual cognition of Artificial Intelligence can realize the recognition of facial expressions and the changes in video images, which supports high-precision and long-cycle measurements on individuals’ affective experience in outdoor environments. Taking an urban community square as the study site, this research simultaneously collects participants’ facial data from video images and their electrodermal activity data, wherein Convolutional Neural Network algorithm model is trained with a deep learning algorithm, i.e. codec–SVM optimized model, whose reliability is tested through an additional experiment. The research reveals that: 1) The accuracy rate of the main and additional experiments in measuring individuals’ affective experience is 82.01% and 65.08%, respectively; 2) The additional experiment verifies the application potential of the codec–SVM optimized model; And 3) the model works more effective for outdoor scenarios with varying usage behaviors and open views. Therefore, machine visual cognition can be used for emotion measurement in a larger site area or sample size and contributes to the effectiveness of landscape optimization efforts, especially as an instrumental tool to study the affective experience of the ones who have communication or reading disability. The findings also demonstrate the model’s great potential in building Smart Cities with refined public services. © 2021 Higher Education Press Limited Company.

However, limited by image analysis methods, existing studies on the relationship between environmental visual factors and traffic safety are mainly qualitative and it is difficult to conduct large-scale quantitative analysis of the visual environment. This study used rich, easy-to-extract and growing streetscape images as the data source of environmental factors, and extracts the image feature information, location information and sensory information of streetscape through methods such as expanded residual network (DRN). And Pearson correlation coefficients and ridge regression were used to screen quantitative indicators to construct a quantitative analysis framework for the association between visual environment and traffic safety based on deep learning, providing a new quantitative means to study urban landscapes. In addition, statistical analysis methods were used to identify the influencing factors that lead to changes in road traffic safety conditions. On the one hand, the variability in the contribution of influencing factors associated with the urban landscape to accident rates in different urban areas was explored. For example, an increase in the proportion of ""vegetation"" in commercial and older urban areas has a positive impact on traffic safety, but the opposite is true in suburban areas. On the other hand, patterns that may advance urban planning theory are also discovered. For example, the closer the road unit is to the city center, the safer the traffic conditions. This paper offered a new way of thinking about the link between urban landscape and traffic safety in quantitative terms, and offered the possibility for assessing urban traffic safety conditions efficiently and on a large scale. © 2021, Editorial Department, Journal of South China University of Technology.

When billions of IoT devices are streaming in the smart city, realizing low-latency and high-bandwidth services has a significant impact on the benefits of smart cities. Thus, managing resources efficiently and intelligently to meet various service requirements has become a challenge for smart cities. With the rapid development of machine intelligence, it can be considered that many machines constitute a machine society just like that of human beings. Inspired by the efficient and collaborative operation mechanism of human society, we propose a socialized learning scheme to address various needs in smart cities (e.g., reasonable resource allocation). Specifically, we present the socialized learning scheme from three perspectives. First, we design a cognitive paradigm of socialized learning to enlighten the long-term vision of applying learning-based resource management to smart cities, with comprehensive discussions of three dimensions consisting of architecture, decision, and knowledge. Second, we also probe the socialized learning methodology including socialized training and socialized inference. It highlights social relationships and introduces a series of technologies to realize social relations within and across layers. Finally, we give a socialized learning solution for solving the practical resource allocation problem in smart cities, thereby jointly improving decision accuracy and reducing training costs.

How to predict the taxi waiting time accurately at a certain time and location is the key solution for the imbalance between the taxis’ supplies and demands. Considering the life schedule of urban residents and the different functions of geogrid regions, the research developed in this paper introduces a spatio-temporal schedule-based neural network for urban taxi waiting time prediction. The approach integrates a series of multi-source data from taxi trajectories to city points of interest, different time frames and human behaviors in the city. We apply a grid-based and functional structuration of an urban space that provides a lower-level data representation. Overall, the neural network model can dynamically predict the waiting time of taxi passengers in real time under some given spatio-temporal constraints. The experimental results show that the granular-based grids and spatio-temporal neural network can effectively predict and optimize the accuracy of taxi waiting times.

However, the existing feature fusion methods with bottom-up structures can achieve limited fusion results. Alternatively, various auxiliary fusion modules significantly increase the complexity of the models and make the training process intolerably expensive. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight model called top-down pyramid fusion network (TdPFNet) including a multi-source feature extractor, a top-down pyramid fusion module and a decoder. It can deeply fuse features from different sources in a top-down structure using high-level semantic knowledge guiding the fusion of low-level texture information. Digital surface model (DSM) data and open street map (OSM) data are used as auxiliary inputs to the Potsdam dataset for the proposed model evaluation. Experimental results show that the network proposed in this paper not only notably improves the segmentation accuracy, but also reduces the complexity of the multi-source semantic segmentation model. © 2021 by the authors.

Recent developments in artificial intelligence can give researchers and city developers powerful tools, and through their usage, new insights can be gained on this issue. Discovering a high-level structure in a set of observations within a low-dimensional manifold is a common strategy used when applying machine learning techniques to tackle several problems while finding a projection from and onto the underlying data distribution. This so-called latent manifold can be used in many applications such as clustering, data visualization, sampling, density estimation, and unsupervised learning. Moreover, data of city patterns has some particularities, such as having superimposed or natural patterns that correspond to those of the depicted locations. In this research, multiple manifolds are explored and derived from city pattern images. A set of quantitative and qualitative tests are proposed to examine the quality of these manifolds. In addition, to demonstrate these tests, a novel specialized dataset of city patterns of multiple locations is created, with the dataset capturing a set of recognizable superimposed patterns. © 2021 by the authors.

For this reason, several countries focus on electricity production using alternative sources. In this paper, the optimal positioning of the installation of wave energy converters is examined taking into account geospatial and technical limitations. Geospatial constraints depend on Land Use classes and seagrass of the coastal areas, while technical limitations include meteorological conditions and the morphology of the seabed. Suitable installation areas are selected after the exclusion of points that do not meet the aforementioned restrictions. We implemented a Deep Neural Network that operates based on heterogeneous data fusion, in this case satellite images and time series of meteorological data. This fact implies the definition of a two-branches architecture. The branch that is trained with image data provides for the localization of dynamic geospatial classes in the potential installation area, whereas the second one is responsible for the classification of the region according to the potential wave energy using wave height and period time series. In making the final decision on the suitability of the potential area, a large number of static land use data play an important role. These data are combined with neural network predictions for the optimizing positioning of the Wave Energy Converters. For the sake of completeness and flexibility, a Multi-Task Neural Network is developed. This model, in addition to predicting the suitability of an area depending on seagrass patterns and wave energy, also predicts land use classes through Multi-Label classification process. The proposed methodology is applied in the marine area of the city of Sines, Portugal.

To date, multiple land uses are experiencing urban construction-related land expansion, population increase, and socioeconomic development. Comprehensive evaluation and understanding of the effect of urban sprawl and its rapid LUCC are of great importance to managing land surface resources for sustainable development. The present research applied remote sensing data, such as Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat-8 Operation Land Imager, on selected images between July and August from 1985 to 2020 with the use of multiple types of software to explore, classify, and analyze the historical and future LUCCs in Baghdad City. Three historical LUCC maps from 1985, 2000, and 2020 were created and analyzed. The result shows that urban construction land expands quickly, and agricultural land and natural vegetation have had a large loss of coverage during the last 35 years. The change analysis derived from previous land use was used as a change direction for future simulation, where natural and anthropogenic factors were selected as the drivers’ variables in the process of multilayer perceptron neural network Markov chain model. The future land use/cover change (FLUCC) modeling results from 2030 to 2050 show that agriculture is the only land use type with a massive decreasing trend from 1985 to 2050 compared with other categories. The entire change in urban sprawl derived from historical and FLUCC in each period shows that urban construction land increases the fastest between 2020 and 2030. The rapid urbanization along with unplanned urban growth and rising population migration from rural to urban is the main driver of all transformation in land use. These findings facilitate sustainable ecological development in Baghdad City and theoretically support environmental decision making. © 2021 by the authors.

However, people do not always have accepting attitudes toward smart city services. The purpose of this study was to identify the expectations and anxieties that people have toward five typical services in smart cities (social credit, artificial intelligence (AI) cameras, health information, garbage collection, and automatic vehicles) by using mainly open-ended questions. An online survey was conducted with Japanese participants by presenting them with one of the five vignettes about the services described above. The results showed that the participants’ expectations from each service were distinctly different between the vignettes. Anxieties about the leakage of personal information were found for the vignettes of social credit and health information. For the vignettes of AI cameras and garbage collection, anxieties that privacy would not be sufficiently ensured and that people would be involved in a surveillance society were noted. Additionally, the participants tended to exhibit lower accepting attitudes toward services considered to capture a large amount of personal information.

The DL model uses an efficient sub-pixel convolution layer to generate HR information from LR data, with adversarial training applied to improve physical consistency. The DL model reduces temperature errors significantly over urbanized areas present in the LR simulation, while also demonstrating considerable skill in capturing the magnitude and location of heat stress indicators.

The use cases of massive IoT consist of the smart city, digital agriculture, smart traffic, etc., in which the service requirements are different and even constantly changing. To fulfill the different requirements, the networks must be able to automatically adjust the network configuration, architectures, resource allocations, and other network parameters according to the different scenarios to match the different service requirements in massive IoT, which are beyond the abilities of the fifth generation (5G) networks. Moreover, the sixth generation (6G) networks are expected to have endogenous intelligence, which can well support the massive IoT application scenarios. In this paper, we first propose the framework of the 6G self-evolving networks, in which the autonomous decision-making is one of the vital parts. Then, we introduce the autonomous decision-making methods and analyze the characteristics of the different methods and mechanisms for 6G networks. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we consider one of the typical scenarios of massive IoT and propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-based distributed decision-making algorithm to solve the problem of the offloading policy and the network resource allocation. Simulation results show that the proposed decision-making algorithm with the self-evolving networks can improve the quality of experience (QoE) compared with the lower training. © 2021 by the authors.

In recent years, several countries have made huge investments in developing smart cities to offer sustainable living. However, there are some challenges to overcome in smart city development, such as traffic and transportation man-agement, energy and water distribution and management, air quality and waste management mon-itoring, etc. The capabilities of the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) can help to achieve some goals of smart cities, and there are proven examples from some cities like Singapore, Copenhagen, etc. However, the adoption of AI and the IoT in developing countries has some chal-lenges. The analysis of challenges hindering the adoption of AI and the IoT are very limited. This study aims to fill this research gap by analyzing the causal relationships among the challenges in smart city development, and contains several parts that conclude the previous scholars’ work, as well as independent research and investigation, such as data collection and analysis based on DE-MATEL. In this paper, we have reviewed the literature to extract key challenges for the adoption of AI and the IoT. These helped us to proceed with the investigation and analyze the adoption status. Therefore, using the PRISMA method, 10 challenges were identified from the literature review. Sub-sequently, determination of the causal inter-relationships among the key challenges based on expert opinions using DEMATEL is performed. This study explored the driving and dependent power of the challenges, and causal relationships between the barriers were established. The results of the study indicated that “lack of infrastructure (C1)”, ”insufficient funds (C2)”, “cybersecurity risks (C3)”, and “lack of trust in AI, IoT” are the causal factors that are slowing down the adoption of AI and IoT in smart city development. The inter-relationships between the various challenges are pre-sented using a network relationship map, cause–effect diagram. The study’s findings can help regulatory bodies, policymakers, and researchers to make better decisions to overcome the challenges for developing sustainable smart cities. © 2021 by the authors.

Previous research using contextual features, using mainly very-high-spatial-resolution imagery (<2 m spatial resolution) at subnational to city scales, has found strong correlations with population and poverty. Contextual features can be defined as the statistical quantification of edge patterns, pixel groups, gaps, textures, and the raw spectral sig-natures calculated over groups of pixels or neighborhoods. While they correlated with population and poverty, which components of the human-modified landscape were captured by the contextual features have not been investigated. Additionally, previous research has focused on more costly, less frequently acquired very-high-spatial-resolution imagery. Therefore, contextual features from both very-high-spatial-resolution imagery and lower-spatial-resolution Sentinel-2 (10 m pixels) imagery in Sri Lanka, Belize, and Accra, Ghana were calculated, and those outputs were correlated with OpenStreetMap building and road metrics. These relationships were compared to determine what components of the human-modified landscape the features capture, and how spatial resolution and location impact the predictive power of these relationships. The results suggest that contextual features can map urban attributes well, with out-of-sample R2 values up to 93%. Moreover, the degradation of spatial resolution did not significantly reduce the results, and for some urban attributes, the results actually improved. Based on these results, the ability of the lower resolution Sentinel-2 data to predict the population density of the smallest census units available was then assessed. The findings indicate that Sentinel-2 contextual features explained up to 84% of the out-of-sample variation for population density. © 2021 by the authors.

The best practice of effective water management comes from ancient civilizations that, despite their technologies and practices, were unable to prevent collapse from water scarcity. In the 21st century, in an era of climate change, pollution or population explosion, cities are looking for innovative ways to effectively manage scarce resources for future generations. Which elements should cities of the future follow to avoid water collapse? The following article aims to identify the key elements of effective management and to represent them graphically in the form of a recommended model, which will be verified in the future in Slovakia. The article uses case analysis of best past and current practices, comparison and summarization to identify the elements, creativity, and logic in the development of the model, including induction and deduction. The article serves as a basis for fellow researchers (analyses carried out) and strategic urban management (effective urban water management). The main finding of the article is that ecological change puts pressure on social elements and therefore it is necessary to focus on the area of strategic management. Cities should not only know how to manage resource abundance or short-term scarcity, but also long-term scarcity. They should use elements of trust, awareness and continuous improvement through modern monitoring technologies (UAVs, sensors) and prediction (machine learning).

The management wants to achieve water balance by 2027 based on a holistic water management approach in the context of Smart City development. To meet the set goal, integrated water management uses action plans at local, national, and European level [42].

Their motto is to preserve resources and cities for future generations. The object of the activity is the creation of so-called blue-green infrastructure based on lakes and green spaces for the needs of a simple process of water seepage and its capture in the lower layers, which reduces the risk of flooding and water scarcity.

In this paper, we review the state of the art of IoT in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), identify challenges posed by cloud, fog, and edge computing in ITS, and develop a methodology based on agile optimization algorithms for solving a dynamic ride-sharing problem (DRSP) in the context of edge/fog computing.These algorithms allow us to process, in real time, the data gathered from IoT systems in order to optimize automatic decisions in the city transportation system, including: optimizing the vehicle routing, recommending customized transportation modes to the citizens, generating efficient ride-sharing and car-sharing strategies, create optimal charging station for electric vehicles and different services within urban and interurban areas. A numerical example considering a DRSP is provided, in which the potential of employing edge/fog computing, open data, and agile algorithms is illustrated. © 2021 by the authors.

Moreover, it is not possible to continually modify urban road infrastructure in order to mitigate increasing traffic demand. Therefore, it is important to develop traffic control models that can handle high-volume traffic data and synchronize traffic lights in an urban network in real time, without interfering with other initiatives. Within this context, this study proposes a model, based on deep reinforcement learning, for synchronizing the traffic signals of an urban traffic network composed of two intersections. The calibration of this model, including training of its neural network, was performed using real traffic data collected at the approach to each intersection. The results achieved through simulations were very promising, yielding significant improvements in indicators measured in relation to the pre-existing conditions in the network. The model was able to deal with a broad spectrum of traffic flows and, in peak demand periods, reduced delays and queue lengths by more than 28% and 42%, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

Various deep learning models have been proposed to extract building information, showing both strengths and weaknesses in capturing the complex spectral and spatial characteristics of buildings in remote sensing images. To integrate the strengths of individual models and obtain fine-scale spatial and spectral building information, this study proposed a stacking ensemble deep learning model. First, an optimization method for the prediction results of the basic model is proposed based on fully connected conditional random fields (CRFs). On this basis, a stacking ensemble model (SENet) based on a sparse autoencoder integrating U-NET, SegNet, and FCN-8s models is proposed to combine the features of the optimized basic model prediction results. Utilizing several cities in Hebei Province, China as a case study, a building dataset containing attribute labels is established to assess the performance of the proposed model. The proposed SENet is compared with three individual models (U-NET, SegNet and FCN-8s), and the results show that the accuracy of SENet is 0.954, approximately 6.7%, 6.1%, and 9.8% higher than U-NET, SegNet, and FCN-8s models, respectively. The identification of building features, including colors, sizes, shapes, and shadows, is also evaluated, showing that the accuracy, recall, F1 score, and intersection over union (IoU) of the SENet model are higher than those of the three individual models. This suggests that the proposed ensemble model can effectively depict the different features of buildings and provides an alternative approach to building extraction with higher accuracy. © 2021 by the authors.

Producers, food industries and or traders have difficulties in defining the period when fruit are at the highest level of quality desired by consumers in terms of the physical-chemical parameters (hardness –H–, soluble solids content –SSC–, and acidity –Ac–). The evolution of peach quality in terms of these parameters depends directly on storage temperature –T– and relative humidity –RH–, as well on the storage duration –t–. This paper describes an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Decision Support System (DSS) designed to predict the evolution of the quality of peaches, namely the storage time re-quired before commercialization as well as the late commercialization time. The peaches quality is stated in terms of the values of SSC, H and Ac that consumers most like for the storage T and RH. An Artificial neuronal network (ANN) is proposed to provide this prediction. The training and val-idation of the ANN were conducted with experimental data acquired in three different farmers’ cold storage facilities. A user interface was developed to provide an expedited and simple prediction of the marketable time of peaches, considering the storage temperature, relative humidity, and initial physical and chemical parameters. This AI DSS may help the vegetable sector (logistics and retailers), especially smaller neighborhood grocery stores, define the marketable period of fruit. It will contribute with advantages and benefits for all parties—producers, traders, retailers, and con-sumers—by being able to provide fruit at the highest quality and reducing waste in the process. In this sense, the ANN DSS proposed in this study contributes to new AI-based solutions for smart cities. © 2021 by the author.

Methods for an ex-ante appraisal of such sparsely defined vision are limited in the literature. By adapting a reference class forecasting (RCF) methodology, we propose an innovative two-stage combination of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) as an explainable ANN strategy to the appraisal of urban planning vision outline. The SEM-ANN operationalizes interaction between job, resident, and multi-modal accessibility in a public transport-dominated city. This strategy is applied to Lantau Tomorrow Vision in Hong Kong, as an extreme case study of a large, reclaimed island. The vision is broadly outlined as a New Town with a third CBD, residential and job targets, road and urban rail transport infrastructure routing, and an overall cost. The results show that the New Town scenario job/population goal should be plausibly attainable by increasing the transport infrastructure accessibility supply. Yet, the simulation indicates that the CBD3 employment goal based on CBD1 is out of range.

However, obtaining such data is time-consuming and expensive since lane annotations have to be annotated manually by humans and are as such hard to scale to large areas. In this work, we propose a novel approach for lane geometry estimation from bird's-eye-view images. We formulate the problem of lane shape and lane connections estimation as a graph estimation problem where lane anchor points are graph nodes and lane segments are graph edges. We train a graph estimation model on multimodal bird's-eye-view data processed from the popular NuScenes dataset and its map expansion pack. We furthermore estimate the direction of the lane connection for each lane segment with a separate model which results in a directed lane graph. We illustrate the performance of our LaneGraphNet model on the challenging NuScenes dataset and provide extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation. Our model shows promising performance for most evaluated urban scenes and can serve as a step towards automated generation of HD lane annotations for autonomous driving.

Among them, for industrial smart harbor and logistics platforms, this paper proposes a novel two-stage algorithm for large-scale surveillance. For the purpose, this paper utilizes drones for flexible localization, and thus, the algorithm for scheduling between multiple drones and multiple multi-access edge computing (MEC) systems is proposed under the consideration of stability in this first-stage. After the scheduling, each drone transmits its own data to its associated MEC for enhancing the quality and then eventually the data will be used for surveillance. For improving the quality, super-resolution is used.

To quantitatively assess the future trends of flood risks and to carry out effective adaptation measures are among the hot topics for flood risk management. A sound answer needs fine-scale data to support an integrative analysis of hydrology-hydrodynamic processes, socio-economic impacts, and adaptation measures. In this regard, this paper puts forward a set of multidisciplinary and comprehensive methods to address the frontier scientific issues. First, internet big data and machine learning methods were adopted to map the building footprint, height, and its economic values, providing a fine-scale spatial and economic information of elements at risk. The residential building footprint was mapped with an accuracy of 92.8%, and the housing price was derived via web crawler from different online real estate websites. Second, the hydrology-hydrodynamic models of TOMAWAC, TELEMAC and MIKE 1D/2D were integrated to simulate four storm-surge flooding scenarios. The scenarios are based on the real Typhoon event TC9711 on August 18, 1997, whereby the wind, wave, tide, 1D flood, and 2D flood processes are simulated and flood scenarios of four different return periods are extrapolated. Especially, for future scenarios in 2050, sea level rise and land subsidence are also considered. Third, the expected annual damage (EAD) is estimated via risk analysis technique with combination of flood maps in the four return periods and the fine-scale exposure data. Finally, a cost-benefit analysis was done to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of two flood adaptation measures, i.e., dry flood-proofing and wet flood-proofing measures, for residential buildings. Taking Shanghai as an example, the above methods were applied to comprehensively assess the storm-caused flood risk of residential buildings, its future trends to 2050, and the costs and benefits of two adaptation measures. The results show that: (1) Sea-level rise and land subsidence will significantly exacerbate the flood risks in Shanghai. (2) Under the three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5, RCP8.5 and RCP8.5 High-end), the area of exposed residential buildings in Shanghai by 2050 may reach 31-49 km2 (4%-6% of total building area) for a 1/200-year storm flood event and 180-206 km2 (14%-16%) for a 1/5000-year event. (3) The EAD of residential buildings in 2017 is 440 million CNY (65.4 million USD), which can increase 1.6-2.0 times and reach to CNY 700 million-900 million (104.0 million-133.8 million USD) in 2050. (4) The implementation of both dry and wet flood-proofing measures could potentially reduce the EAD by 76%-79% and 88%-90%, respectively. Both measures are considerably cost-effective: the net present values of dry and wet flood-proofing measures are 2.84 billion-5.53 billion CNY (0.4 billion-0.8 billion USD) and 5.85 billion-9.94 billion CNY (0.9 billion-1.5 billion USD), and the benefit/cost ratios are 1.9-2.4 and 7.9-9.8 respectively. This indicates that the cost-effectiveness of dry flood-proofing measures is less than that of wet measure. Our findings can provide both scientific understanding and effective adaptation measures for mitigating the future flood risk in Shanghai. These multidisciplinary methods could also be applied to assess flood risk and adaptation strategies in other coastal cities. © 2021, Science Press.

To improve the demand management and operation efficiency, it is crucial to have accurate prediction of real-time metro passenger flow. However, the forecast performance is often subject to the complex spatial and temporal distributions of the metro passenger flow data. To this end, we developed a novel dual attentive graph neural network that can effectively predict the distribution of metro traffic flow considering the spatial and temporal influences. Specifically, two directed complete metro graphs (i.e., inbound and outbound graphs) and the weighted matrix of them are proposed to characterize the inbound (entering the system) and outbound (leaving the system) passenger flow, respectively. The weighted matrix of inbound graph is estimated based on the historical origin-destination demand and that of the outbound graph is estimated based on the similarity metrics between every two stations. Moreover, to capture the dependencies between inbound and outbound flows, multi-layer graph spatial attention networks that incorporate the spatial context are applied to exploit the dynamic inter-station correlations. Then, the acquired dependency features integrated with external factors, such as weather conditions, are filtered by temporal attention and fed into a sequence decoder to produce short-term and long-term passenger flow predictions. Finally, a series experiments are conducted based on a comprehensive empirical dataset. Findings indicated that the proposed model does not only well predict the metro passenger flow, but also effectively detect the emergencies and incidents of metro system. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",,Article,Final,All Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112474464,Yes,China,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,Graph Neural Network (Dual Attention),Prediction/Forecasting,Predict metro passenger flow using dual attentive graph neural network,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Weak

Although much research has been done on this subject, the efficiency and accuracy of existing water meter pointer reading technology can still be improved. This paper proposes a new water meter pointer reading recognition method based on target-key point detection. Our method consists of a target detection module and a key point detection module. The target detection module uses a modified YOLOv4-Tiny network to detect and classify the areas where the dials and pointers are located in water meter images with distinct characteristics. The key point detection module is used to detect the key point of the pointer image. In this module, the structure of the RFB-Net network is improved to introduce multiple layers of low-level feature information, therefore, it can make full use of the information between multi-scale feature layers for key point detection. In addition to, aiming at the problem of dial rotation, a method of establishing a right-angle coordinate system based on key point is proposed to realize pointer reading. The whole method proposed in this paper is compared to the Hough transform feature matching algorithm and traditional machine learning algorithms through experiments which test the detection and recognition of the water meter dial, pointer and key points. The experiment results show that the missed detection rate of the model in this paper is 1.88% and 1.07% for the dial region and the pointer region, respectively. And the accuracy rate reaches 98.68%, the average processing time per image is 0.37 s. This implies that the water meter inspection task is completed quickly and accurately with strong robustness. Thanks to the lightweight algorithm of our approach, the model can also be fully automated and easily deployed on mobile devices. © 2021","This paper is supported by the Key Research and Development Plan Program of Zhejiang province, China (grant NO. 2020C03094 ).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112437225,Yes,China,Water,Water & Sanitation,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Deep Learning (YOLO),Object Detection,Recognize water meter pointer readings using target-key point detection for smart cities,"SDG 6 (Water), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Methodological,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) refers to an IoT application, where the urban vehicle fleet forms a worldwide network, using V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) communications. The 5G is the new generation of cellular networks that will eliminate the bounds of bandwidth, performance, and latency limitations. IoV is one of the high-priority application domains for 5G. Among the under development IEEE Standard regarding 5G, the IEEE P1931.1 standard (named also Real-time Onsite Operations Facilitation (ROOF) Standard) seems to be very promising for IoV requirements. This paper proposes ROOF-based Named Data Vehicular Networking (RND − V<inf>n</inf>), a named data networking (NDN) architecture for IoV. In addition to the proposal, we provide SeCrND<inf>n</inf> (Searchable Encryption for Content Retrieval in NDN), a searchable encryption technique for NDN content retrieval. Furthermore, we propose the intelligent Named Data Caching (iNDC), a machine-learning–based data caching technique for ROOF-based named data networking. The iNDC predicts the number of content requests, such that popular contents are kept as long as possible on roadside units. The proposed iNDC is also used to predict the storage capacity required by each roadside unit. A performance study was conducted to evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms applied to iNDC. The results show that linear and ridge regressions are the most efficient in terms of content popularity prediction. To predict the capacity of new roadside units, iNDC provides better accuracy using k-Nearest Neighbors. © 2021, Institut Mines-Télécom and Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85110773282,Yes,Algeria,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,Not Specified,Not Specified,Propose named data networking architecture for Internet of Vehicles in 5G smart cities,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Conceptual/Theoretical,Qualitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Medium

Predicting the growth of the cities helps the government to provide the infrastructure facilities. Getting to know the number of built-up areas indirectly points to population increase or decrease. The percentage of the land occupied by built-up areas or non-built-up areas can be found out using the remotely sensed images. Land use and land cover (LULC) of these images point out how the land has been used, whether the land is a water body, vegetation, soil or built-up area. This work explores the combination of the remote sensing images and the use multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based cellular automata (CA) for predicting the changes in the LULC on a later date, using two different initial LULC maps as the input. Four basic classes, namely water, vegetation, built-up and soil, have been considered in this work. Machine learning algorithm (Random Forest Classifier) is used to obtain the LULC map of all the 3 years under consideration, namely 2013, 2016 and 2019. The LULC map of the years 2013 and 2016 acts as the initial rasters for the prediction, whereas the LULC map of the year 2019 is used for validation. The novelty of the work lies in the use of Normalized Difference Built-up index raster along with the roadway map, as the spatial variables in the MLP-based CA. The predicted results show an increase of 12.65% in the built-up areas, decrease of the soil class by 5.23%, decrease of the vegetation by 6.63% and decrease in the water bodies by 0.79% compared the base year considered (2013). The predicted LULC map using the proposed model is then validated against an independently obtained LULC map of 2019.

As one of the bottlenecks to improve transportation efficiency, intersection management plays an important role in the urban city. When the dynamic control method in different cases is determined, the key of autonomous intersection management problem is to search the passing orders for approaching connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). The paper proposed a framework based on convolutional neural network to predict different passing orders’ total time consumption. Thus, the best passing order with the lowest time consume can be chosen as the optimal solution. Then continuous-time optimal control can be carried out on CAVs. Meanwhile, sequential model-based algorithm configuration technique is used for neural network training. Simulation results exported from Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) indicate that the proposed method outperforms actuated signal control and first come first serve strategy. The average delay of the proposed method can decrease by 42.40%–73.05% compared with actuated signal control and 2.95%–55.29% compared to first come first serve strategy. Moreover, it can increase average speed by more than 20% compared with the other two methods. The proposed method can significantly reduce the computation time comparing with the original planning-based strategy. At last, the framework can be applied to other regression tasks like vehicle emissions, then different optimization targets can be estimated to get better solutions faster. © 2021, Korean Society of Civil Engineers.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85110363019,Yes,China,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,CNN,Prediction/Forecasting,Improve autonomous intersection management planning using CNN for passing order prediction,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Longitudinal,Strong

For most cities, municipal governments have constructed basic building contour databases for basic land resource management and urban planning. These building contour databases, however, need to be updated regularly to ensure their validity. Cities are dynamic, changing rapidly over short periods, thus there is an urgent need for automatic methods to produce up-to-date building footprints. Even fully supervised automated methods have major limitations in the building footprint updating process because the labels for current buildings or changed areas are lacking. Moreover, state-of-the-art automatic schemes even some based on deep learning approaches, however, often fail to precisely depict building boundaries, jeopardizing effective updating of building databases. To address these interrelated problems, we developed a novel algorithm to automatically update the existing building databases to their current status with minimal manual intervention; the saliency-guided edge-preservation framework (named SG-EPUNet) for updating existing building databases and producing up-to-date building footprints. This neural network-based method can update building footprints from remote sensing images, requiring manual annotations for only 20% of the buildings. To robustly extract building features, we designed an edge-preservation neural network (EPUNet) that combines edge detection with contextual aggregation in the proposed SG-EPUNet framework. We applied the methods on two datasets from Christchurch, New Zealand, and Guangzhou, China, to assess the effectiveness of the method in urban and suburban areas. For both study areas, the F1-score values for the building update results reached approximately 97%, which confirmed the applicability of the SG-EPUNet framework. The results also show that SG-EPUNet maintains robustness to large areas, even with very limited ground truth labeling. The joint combination of building prior and very high-resolution remote sensing images makes the proposed method a promising approach for automatically producing up-to-date building footprints in practical applications.

High-resolution optical satellite images can provide fine spatial details within urban areas, while they have not been applied to building height estimation over multiple cities and the feasibility of mapping building height at a fine scale (< 5 m) remains understudied. Multi-view satellite images can describe vertical information of buildings, due to the inconsistent response of buildings (e.g., spectral and structural variations) to different viewing angles, but they have not been employed to deep learning-based building height estimation. In this context, we introduce high-resolution ZY-3 multi-view images to estimate building height at a spatial resolution of 2.5 m. We propose a multi-spectral, multi-view, and multi-task deep network (called M3Net) for building height estimation, where ZY-3 multi-spectral and multi-view images are fused in a multi-task learning framework. A random forest (RF) method using multi-source features is also carried out for comparison. We select 42 Chinese cities with diverse building types to test the proposed method. Results show that the M3Net obtains a lower root mean square error (RMSE) than the RF, and the inclusion of ZY-3 multi-view images can significantly lower the uncertainty of building height prediction. Comparison with two existing state-of-the-art studies further confirms the superiority of our method, especially the efficacy of the M3Net in alleviating the saturation effect of high-rise building height estimation. Compared to the vanilla single/multi-task models, the M3Net also achieves a lower RMSE. Moreover, the spatial-temporal transferability test indicates the robustness of the M3Net to imaging conditions and building styles. The test of our method on a relatively large area (covering about 14,120 km2) further validates the scalability of our method from the perspectives of both efficacy and quality.

Unplanned expansion of cities and the impacts of climate change increase risks and pose challenges to sustainable development. Urban flooding is a hazard that is attributed to an increase in built-up area and extreme weather events. Despite this, little has been done to understand the impact of urbanization and climate change, particularly in the big cities of Africa. This research integrated GIS, remote sensing, and statistical analysis to study past and future urban development patterns, rainfall trends, and their impact on urban flooding risk in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Future urbanization scenarios were developed using an integrated artificial neural network–Markov model in the IDRISI Selva 17.0 software, while a soil conservation service–curve number model and a Mann–Kendell test were employed to study direct runoff and trends in precipitation. The methodology and workflow were designed to address limitations of conducting empirical study, especially for developing countries, caused by the lack of detailed data on past and present conditions like land-use maps, networks of meteorological stations, and soil-related datasets such as soil texture and moisture. The results indicate that rapid urbanization is the major cause of flooding in Addis Ababa, spiking from 80.1 km2 in 1984 to 287.9 km2 in 2020 and expected to increase to 367.1 km2 in 2030 under a business-as-usual scenario. The fast urbanization has increased the number of flooding susceptible woredas (smallest administrative units) to a direct runoff depth of 25 mm from 40 in 1984 to 81 in 2020. On the other hand, no statistically significant increase has been found in the city’s precipitation trend from 1976 to 2015. Furthermore, the flooding risk is likely to increase given the historical pattern of urban expansion and its current speed, as the number of flooding susceptible woredas increase to 90 in 2030 under the business-as-usual scenario. Thus, smart growth management on urban expansion and dense inner-city development are recommended to reduce the flooding risk. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",This work was supported by the New Faculty Startup Fund from Seoul National University and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. NRF-2017R1C1B1004785).,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85108825386,Yes,South Korea,Water,Disaster Management,Urban Resilience & Safety,"GIS, Statistical Analysis",Prediction/Forecasting,Study urbanization impact on flood hazard in Addis Ababa integrating GIS and remote sensing,"SDG 6 (Water), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 13 (Climate)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Longitudinal,Strong

Most developed cities have suffered from severe air quality as population growth and industrialization grow rapidly. Government agencies and citizens are increasingly concerned about air quality, which has an impact on various areas of the human environment and human advancement. Conventional methods of air pollution forecasting primarily use low-level simulations, and these models generate disappointing results that have led us to factors that influence air pollution measurement based on a thorough design of the structure. Furthermore, in this paper, Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM) assisted Staked Auto-Encoder (SAE) (LSTM-SAE) model has been proposed for predicting the air quality in smart environment design planning in the smart cities. Long Short- Term Memory is used to evaluate air pollution quality prediction in smart cities. Staked Auto-Encoder (SAE) is modeled and prepared gently to extract the intrinsic components that occur due to air pollution.

It underpins a variety of essential and significant tasks in the development of smart city including face recognition, landmark retrieval, pedestrian detection, person/vehicle re-identification, and so on. Traditional pair-based DML methods try to make full use of the data-to-data relations within a (mini-)batch, but they cannot grasp the data distribution information due to the batch size limitation. On the other hand, proxy-based DML schemes use different proxies to approximate the data distribution. However, the proxies are too sample to represent the intra-category variance.

It can capture the globe data distribution information while depicting the detailed intra-class data structure. The state-of-the-art empirical results on three public image retrieval benchmarks and two backbone networks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.

However, research on sustainable urban roofscapes is rather focused on their potential and it is hindered by the scarcity of data, limiting our understanding of their current content, spatial distribution, and temporal evolution. To tackle this issue, we introduce Roofpedia, a set of three contributions: (i) automatic mapping of relevant urban roof typology from satellite imagery; (ii) an open roof registry mapping the spatial distribution and area of solar and green roofs of more than one million buildings across 17 cities; and (iii) the Roofpedia Index, a derivative of the registry, to benchmark the cities by the extent of sustainable roofscape in term of solar and green roof penetration.

We offer our results as an interactive map and open dataset so that our work could aid researchers, local governments, and the public to uncover the pattern of sustainable rooftops across cities, track and monitor the current use of rooftops, complement studies on their potential, evaluate the effectiveness of existing incentives, verify the use of subsidies and fulfilment of climate pledges, estimate carbon offset capacities of cities, and ultimately support better policies and strategies to increase the adoption of instruments contributing to the sustainable development of cities. © 2021 The Author(s)","Funding text 1: The authors gratefully acknowledge the sources of the input datasets and the discussions with Yoong Shin Chow (NUS Urban Analytics Lab).

The tuning of hyperparameters is of great importance to achieve better accuracy in a landslide hazard assessment model. In this study, a novel approach is proposed for landslide hazard assessment with support vector machine (SVM) as the primary model and Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm as the parameter tuning method. This study describes 1711 historical landslide disaster points in Nanping City, and a total of 12 landslide conditioning factors including elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, lithology, soil type, soil erosion, rainfall, river, land use, highway, and railway were selected. The multicollinearity diagnosis was performed on the factors using the Spearman correlation coefficient. For model validation, 1711 landslides and 1711 non-landslides were collected as the dataset and divided into a training dataset (50 %) and a testing dataset (50 %). The performance of the model was evaluated by the confusion matrix and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The results of the confusion matrix accuracy and the area under the ROC curve showed that the BO-SVM model (89.53 %, 0.97) performed better than the SVM model (84.91 %, 0.93). In addition, the landslide hazard maps generated by the BO-SVM model had better overall results than that by the SVM model. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Funding text 1: The work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41861134011) and (No. 51874268).; Funding text 2: We are grateful to the anonymous reviewers and the Editor for their constructive comments that helped us improve the quality of the paper.

The recent trend of such surveillance systems has been to embrace the use of advanced deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks for the task of detection, monitoring or tracking. In this paper, we focus on the security of an automated surveillance system that is responsible for vehicle make and model recognition (VMMR). We introduce an adversarial attack against such VMMR systems through adversarially learnt patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed adversarial patches against VMMR through experimental evaluations on a real-world vehicle surveillance dataset. The developed adversarial patches achieve reductions of up to 48 % in VMMR recall scores. In addition, we propose a lightweight defense method called SIHFR (stands for Symmetric Image-Half Flip and Replace) to eliminate the effect of adversarial patches on VMMR performance. Through experimental evaluations, we investigate the robustness of the proposed defense method under varying patch placement strategies and patch sizes. The proposed defense method adds a minimal overhead of less than 2ms per image (on average) and succeeds in enhancing VMMR performance by up to 69.28 %. It is hoped that this work shall guide future studies to develop smart city VMMR surveillance systems that are robust to cyber-physical attacks based on adversarially learnt patches. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",This study was partially funded by Canada Research Chairs Program and Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)'s CREATE TRANSIT Program.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107734136,Yes,Canada,Safety/Crime,Security & Safety,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Deep Learning (CNN),Classification,Defend against adversarial patches on automated vehicle make and model recognition systems,"SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 16 (Governance)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Longitudinal,Strong

Understanding spatio-temporal patterns of heat exposure is a critical factor in directing mitigation measures. Current heat vulnerability indices provide insight into heat sensitivities within given communities but do not account for the dynamic nature of the human movement as people travel for different activities. Here, we present a new Dynamic urban Thermal Exposure index (DTEx) that captures the varying heat exposure within urban environments. Methods: We developed the DTEx to understand human heat exposure patterns in a mid-sized city. This index incorporates the human movement pattern and the heat hazard pattern obtained via novel and advanced techniques. We generated the human movement pattern from large-scale, anonymized smartphone location data. The heat hazard patterns were extrapolated via machine learning models from air temperature data measured through vehicle-mounted sensors. The exposure index was then developed by combining the two parameters using their standard-deviation-classified indices. Results: Our exposure index varied between 2 and 12, indicating low to high thermal exposures. Several high-temperature spots associated with a large volume of foot traffic are successfully identified through this DTEx. We observed the hottest spots at shopping plazas but not specifically in the urban center. During the selected football gameday, the exposure index surged across most places near the football stadium but was reduced considerably further away. Discussion: The proposed DTEx is novel because it provides dynamic heat monitoring capability to facilitate heat mitigation strategies at vulnerable locations in urban environments. Combining the mobility data and extensive sensor data generates rich details on the most heat-exposed areas due to human congregation. Such information will be critical for risk communication and urban planning for policymakers. DTEx could also help smart route planning in sustainable cities to avoid heat hazards risks. © 2021 The Authors",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105899590,Yes,United States,Urban Climate,Environment & Sustainability,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Machine Learning,Prediction/Forecasting,Develop dynamic urban thermal exposure index based on human mobility patterns,"SDG 3 (Health), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 13 (Climate)",Methodological,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

As the knowledge and understanding of COVID-19 evolve, an appropriate response plan for this pandemic is considered one of the most effective methods for controlling the spread of the virus. Recent studies indicate that a city Digital Twin (DT) is beneficial for tackling this health crisis, because it can construct a virtual replica to simulate factors, such as climate conditions, response policies, and people's trajectories, to help plan efficient and inclusive decisions. However, a city DTsystem relies on long-term and high-quality data collection to make appropriate decisions, limiting its advantages when facing urgent crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Federated Learning (FL), in which all clients can learn a shared model while retaining all training data locally, emerges as a promising solution for accumulating the insights from multiple data sources efficiently Furthermore, the enhanced privacy protection settings removing the privacy barriers lie in this collaboration. In this work, we propose a framework that fused city DT with FL to achieve a novel collaborative paradigm that allows multiple city DTs to share the local strategy and status quickly. In particular, an FL central server manages the local updates of multiple collaborators (city DTs), providing a global model that is trained in multiple iterations at different city DT systems until the model gains the correlations between various response plans and infection trends. This approach means a collaborative city DT paradigm fused with FL techniques can obtain knowledge and patterns from multiple DTs and eventually establish a 'global view' of city crisis management. Meanwhile, it also helps improve each city's DT by consolidating other DT's data without violating privacy rules. In this paper, we use the COVID-19 pandemic as the use case of the proposed framework. The experimental results on a real dataset with various response plans validate our proposed solution and demonstrate its superior performance. &copy; 2021 Tsinghua University Press. © 2021 Tsinghua University Press.

This study predicted LULC change and their impacts on seasonal (summer and winter) LST variations in Al Kut, Iraq. Landsat TM/OLI images for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020 were used to estimate LULC and LST's past status using remote sensing (RS) techniques. Based on the past characteristics of the images future LULC and seasonal LST were predicted for year 2030. Support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was used to classify the LULC classes. Artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm was used to predict the future LST considering the LULC indexes as influential variables. Results suggest a significant increase in urban area by +8.74% and reduction in green cover by −25.87% from 2000 to 2020. Increment in maximum LST took place for both summer and winter season by 3.79 °C and 3.16 °C in last two decades. Maximum LST was recorded in urban area (48 °C) and water bodies (35 °C) exhibit minimum LST. The correlation study demonstrates a strong positive relation of LST with Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) and negative relation with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). The prediction result also demonstrates increase in urban area (+17.02%) and loss of vegetation cover (−15.57%) for 2030. The maximum LST will likely to increase by 1.62 °C and 2.68 °C for summer and winter seasons in predicted year 2030.

The combination of deep learning methods and RGB optical images obtained by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provides a new research direction for urban tree species classification. We proposed an RGB optical image dataset with 10 urban tree species, termed TCC10, which is a benchmark for tree canopy classification (TCC). TCC10 dataset contains two types of data: tree canopy images with simple backgrounds and those with complex backgrounds. The objective was to examine the possibility of using deep learning methods (AlexNet, VGG-16, and ResNet-50) for individual tree species classification. The results of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were compared with those of K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and BP neural network. Our results demonstrated: (1) ResNet-50 achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 92.6% and a kappa coefficient of 0.91 for tree species classification on TCC10 and outperformed AlexNet and VGG-16. (2) The classification accuracy of KNN and BP neural network was less than 70%, while the accuracy of CNNs was relatively higher. (3) The classification accuracy of tree canopy images with complex backgrounds was lower than that for images with simple backgrounds. For the deciduous tree species in TCC10, the classification accuracy of ResNet-50 was higher in summer than that in autumn. Therefore, the deep learning is effective for urban tree species classification using RGB optical images. © 2020, Northeast Forestry University.","Project funding: This study was supported by Joint Fund of Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang-Qingshanhu Science and Technology City (Grant No. LQY18C160002), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. U1809208), Zhejiang Science and Technology Key R&D Program Funded Project (Grant No. 2018C02013), Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (Grant No. LQ20F020005).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85095115541,Yes,China,Environment,Environment & Sustainability,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Deep Learning,Classification,Classify urban tree species using deep learning and RGB images from UAV,"SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 15 (Land)",Methodological,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

Accurate urban hotspots spatiotemporal prediction can improve urban planning, scheduling and, security capability, reduce resource consumption. Existing deep spatiotemporal prediction methods mainly utilize geographic grid based image, some given network structure or some additional data to capture spatiotemporal dynamic. However, we observed that mining some latent self-semantics from raw data and fusing them with geospatial based grid images can also improve the performance of spatiotemporal predictions. In this paper, we propose Geographic-Semantic Ensemble Neural Network (GSEN), a novel deep learning approach to stack geographical prediction neural network and semantical prediction neutral network.

We conducted a mobile monitoring campaign over 20 days in 2019. Regression models were trained on land use data and combined with predictions from convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained to predict UFP and BC concentrations using satellite and street-level images. The combined UFP model (R2= 0.54) outperformed the CNN (R2= 0.47) and land use regression (LUR) models (R2= 0.47) on their own. Similarly, the combined BC model also outperformed the CNN and LUR BC models (R2= 0.51 vs 0.43 and 0.45, respectively). Spatial variations in model performance were more stable for the CNN and combined models compared to the LUR models, suggesting that the combined approach may be less likely to contribute to differential exposure measurement error in epidemiological studies.

Recently, these methodologies have been combined to predict the influence of this pollutant on human health. However, traditional land-use regression models do not often consider the complex interactions between predictors, and most of these do not include socioeconomic variables. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to estimate suspended particle-related hospital admissions by employing remote sensing, meteorological, environmental, and demographic parameters. In this cohort study, we analyzed 1,612,049 hospital admissions from Córdoba city, Argentina, from 2005 to 2011, and developed several regression and machine learning land-use models to compare their predictive powers. We found that childhood was the age group with the highest number of hospital admissions related with upper respiratory tract diseases. When predicting population-normalized hospital admissions, the machine learning models, in particular the generalized boosted machine, revealed a better performance than regression models, exhibiting the lowest root mean square error (0.4264) in the test data set. This model also achieved the best R2<inf>adj</inf> (0.6088) when plotting predicted vs. reported normalized cases. The most important predictors were the meteorological variables, followed by the aerosol optical depth and the planet boundary layer height. Some other predictors, such as educational level, land value, and unsatisfied basic needs, showed less relevance but enhanced the model's prediction power. Furthermore, the predictive power increased after a 1-day lag in hospital admissions (RMSE = 0.4121), highlighting the importance of meteorological and environmental variables in the onset of respiratory diseases. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","This work received partial support from Agencia Nacional de Promoción de la Investigación, el Desarrollo Tecnológico y la Innovación, Fondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica (Grant PICT-2018-03805 ).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85109481237,Yes,Argentina,Public Health,Health & Well-being,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,"Machine Learning, Remote Sensing",Prediction/Forecasting,Model air pollution-related hospital admissions using remote sensing and GIS,"SDG 3 (Health), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

But it is difficult to accurately estimate the availability of rooftop area for solar radiation on a city-scale. In this study, a generic framework for estimating the rooftop solar PV potential on a city-scale using publicly available high-resolution satellite images is proposed. A deep learning-based method is developed to extract the rooftop area with image semantic segmentation automatically. A spatial optimization sampling strategy is developed to solve the labor-intensive problem when training the rooftop extraction model based on prior knowledge of urban and rural spatial layout and land use. In the case study of Nanjing, China, the labor cost on preparing the dataset for training the rooftop extraction model has been reduced by about 80% with the proposed spatial optimization sampling strategy. Meanwhile, the robustness of the rooftop extraction model in districts with different architectural styles and land use has been improved. The total rooftop area extracted was 330.36 km2, and the overall accuracy reached 0.92. The estimation results show that Nanjing has significant potential for rooftop-mounted PV installations, and the potential installed capacity reached 66 GW.

However, due to the complex background of remote sensing images, some detailed features of building targets are less distinguishable from the background.

Evapotranspiration (ET) is a crucial component of urban greening initiatives of cities worldwide aimed at mitigating these issues. However, ET estimation methods in urban areas have so far been limited. An expanding number of flux towers in urban environments provide the opportunity to directly measure ET by the eddy covariance method. In this study, we present a novel approach to model urban ET by combining flux footprint modeling, remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) data, and deep learning and machine learning techniques. This approach facilitates spatio-temporal extrapolation of ET at a half-hourly resolution; we tested this approach with a two-year dataset from two flux towers in Berlin, Germany. The benefit of integrating remote sensing and GIS data into models was investigated by testing four predictor scenarios. Two algorithms (1D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and random forest (RF)) were compared. The best-performing models were then used to model ET values for the year 2019. The inclusion of GIS data extracted using flux footprints enhanced the predictive accuracy of models, particularly when meteorological data was more limited. The best-performing scenario (meteorological and GIS data) showed an RMSE of 0.0239 mm/h and R2 of 0.840 with RF and an RMSE of 0.0250 mm/h and a R2 of 0.824 with 1D CNN for the more vegetated site. The 2019 ET sum was substantially higher at the site surrounded by more urban greenery (366 mm) than at the inner-city site (223 mm), demonstrating the substantial influence of vegetation on the urban water cycle. The proposed method is highly promising for modeling ET in a heterogeneous urban environment and can support climate change mitigation initiatives of urban areas worldwide. © 2021 The Authors","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) within the Research Training Group ‘Urban Water Interfaces’ ( GRK 2032-2 ).

It reduces the quality of supply, raises production cost, causes legal consumers to pay the higher cost, and impacts the economy as a whole. In this article, we use the State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) dataset, which contains electricity consumption data of 1035 days for two classes: normal and fraudulent. In this work, ET detection model is proposed that consists of four steps: interpolation, data balancing, feature extraction, and classification. First, missing values of the dataset are recovered using the interpolation method. Second, resampling technique is implemented. ET consumers are 9% in the SGCC dataset that make the model inefficient to correctly classify both classes (normal and theft). A hybrid resampling technique is proposed, named synthetic minority oversampling technique with near miss. Third, residual network extracts the latent features from the SGCC dataset. Fourth, three tree based classifiers, such as decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) are applied to train the encoded feature vectors for classification. Besides, search for good hyperparameters is a challenging task, which is usually done manually and takes a considerable amount of time. To resolve this problem, Bayesian optimizer is used to simplify the tuning process of DT, RF, and AdaBoost. Finally, the results indicate that RF outperforms DT and AdaBoost. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","This research was supported by King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (Project number: RSP‐2020/295).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85104619300,Yes,Pakistan,Energy,Smart Grid & Energy,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Machine Learning,Classification,Identify electricity theft using big data analytics and machine learning for smart communities,"SDG 7 (Energy), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Regional,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

Conn and Gabriele de Seta Sinofuturism(s) This A&Q section takes its cue from a statement that is as pervasive as it is seemingly self-­evident: China is the future. This bit of geopolitical folk wisdom, widely shared across popular media and domains of expertise, allows for the proliferation of multiple interpretations: that China will be a thriving future market, that China is on the path to achieving global dominance , that China will prove to be a model for future governance, and so on. Four decades after China’s “reform and opening up” era, its rise on the world stage—­particularly as it involves economic leapfrogging, intensive urbanization, and digital technologies—­seems to unquestionably warrant this assumption of futurity. Forward-­ looking informatization policies, the promotional imaginaries of digital media platforms and the global reach of science fictional narratives, all seem to consolidate the impression that China might, indeed, be the future. And yet, once questioned, this equivalence proves extremely puzzling: To which China is it referring? Whose temporality is it describing? And where is this future situated? Beginning in the early 2000s, tentative answers to these questions have been earmarked under an enticing descriptor: Sinofuturism. One of the earliest uses of this term is attributed to musician and theorist Steve Goodman (1998, 155), who defined it as a “darkside cartography of the turbulent rise of East Asia” that maps “seemingly heterogeneous elements onto the topology of planetary capitalism.” Inspired by Afro­ futurism and embedded in the theoretical-­ fictional milieu of Warwick’s Cybernetic Culture Research Unit, Goodman’s Sinofuturist speculation connects traditional philosophical systems and imperialist endeavors with undercurrents of organized crime and technological networks, offering a dazzling—­ if exoticizing—­ interpretation of China’s rise. Where earlier visions of a “Neo-­ China” arriving from the future thanks to “the A & Q 75 A & Q 75 superiority of Far Eastern Marxism” and exemplified by “Tao-­ drenched Special Economic Zones” (Land 1994) are closer to cyberpunk exotica, more recent articulations of Sinofuturism have been criticized for exhibiting a reactionary “orientalist gushing over Asian techno-­authoritarian city states” (Shen Goodman 2015). When compared to other discourses around Asian temporalities, it becomes apparent that Sinofuturism rehashes many established tropes of Orientalist representation (Roh, Huang, and Niu 2015). In the 1990s, Japan was the subject of what David Morley and Kevin Robins (1995, 168) define as “techno-­ orientalism”; that is, as the country became “synonymous with the technologies of the future,” a generalized panic reflected the anxieties of Western economies suddenly exposed and threatened by Japan’s economic rise. Wendy Hui Kyong Chun (2006, 178) has identified the pervasiveness of this anxiety in cyberpunk narratives, emphasizing how—­in contrast to Edward Said’s original formulation—­this “high-­tech Orientalism” conflates information technology and exoticized urbanism to make otherness and difference readable, to “steer through the future, or more properly represent the future as something that can be negotiated.” Techno-­ Orientalism is articulated to sustain Western imaginations of the future (Ueno 1999, 95) at the same time as global capitalism grapples with the modernization of Asian countries. Morley and Robins (1995, 195) were writing during Japan’s recession and prophetically noted that other Asian economies—­ Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Singapore—­ would be at the center of techno-­Orientalist representations to come. As China’s rise becomes a synecdoche for Asia as a whole, Sinofuturism has emerged as a way of negotiating similar Euro-­ American anxieties about ongoing geopolitical shifts (Ang 2014, 135). Just like techno-­ Orientalism originally thrived on imaginaries of stereotypically Japanese cybernetics, robots, and simulations, Sinofuturism finds validation in the success of China’s informatization. If, by the late 1990s, the internet had barely started to reach Chinese users, as of 2020, the country’s digital industries compete with Silicon Valley tech giants, and Sinofuturist imaginaries have at their disposal a limitless repertoire of digital technologies and social phenomena, including highly localized online cultures, shanzhai manufacturing, smart cities, cryptocurrency mining, and a burgeoning artificial intelligence industry (Renaud, Graezer Bideau, and Laperrouza 2020). In the context of contemporary China, Sinofuturism does not need to speculate about cybernetic undercurrents in the I Ching or find inspiration in Special Economic Zones: digital platforms embrace the rhetoric. © 2021, Studies in Global Asias.

Various digital platforms are emerging as tools not only to store, retrieve, compare and process different kind of data related to CH for the use of urban planners and administrators, but also as participative tools for distributed decision-making. The increasing integration between the physical and digital realm through various digital instruments such as the Internet of things, virtual and augmented reality, machine learning and natural language processing, has led designers to conceptualise the necessity of merging different smart city dashboards and platforms into an integrated system known as the urban digital twin (DW). This task can be made possible only through the construction of a shared ontology of the city, which allows the interoperability of different data systems. The DWs, originally developed in mechanical and process engineering, allow to construct a digital model of a physical object or process, to monitor its real-time performance, to perform maintenance tasks and to test the effects of planned changes. However, when extending the notion of the DW to complex cultural and social entities such as cities, it is important to consider also issues of inclusivity and citizen participation. How can the DW be conceptualised not only as a tool of technological control or narrative, but as an instrument to empower not only institutions but also citizens? The experience gathered in the construction of the ROCK platform and its participatory ontology, developed within the Horizon 2020 (H2020) funded project ROCK (GA 730280), becomes an important precedent in this task. © 2021, International Information and Engineering Technology Association.

The key focus of this article is on understanding long-term distribution of transport demand in order to build bundling networks. To achieve this aim, we provide a hybrid machine-learning approach using a combination of several clustering and forecasting algorithms that are considered efficient given the key performance indicators obtained. This approach involves combining two types of algorithms: clustering and prediction algorithms. Based on simulated benchmarks, results indicated that the clustering phase is still appropriate using the k-means algorithm. To improve the k-means results, we measured 30 validation indices to estimate the number of clusters. In so doing, not only does it want to validate the clusters but also to identify the optimal. To evaluate forecast accuracy in the demand prediction phase, we used the standard key performance indicators, namely MSE, RMSE, MAPE and R . The SVM algorithm has been judged as the most efficient prediction algorithm based on average values of the obtained metrics. © 2021 Institute for Transport Studies in the European Economic Integration.

Traditional two-dimensional landscape pattern cannot completely reflect the ecological structure and functional characteristics of urban landscape. In this study, we used the three-dimensional landscape pattern metrics to quantify the regional three-dimensional landscape pattern, and used boosted regression tree (BRT) machine learning algorithms to comprehensively analyze the interaction between social-environmental factors and urban landscape patterns in the central part of Shanghai. Results showed that high building ratio, mean architecture height, and architecture height standard deviation had higher values in the surrounding area of the inner ring. The number of buildings and landscape shape index were higher in the outer ring than those in other area. Building coverage ratio, floor area ratio and Shannon's diversity index had higher values in the central part, with the metrics of Puxi being generally higher than those of Pudong. Population density and normalized vegetation index (NDVI) interacted most significantly with the three-dimensional landscape pattern, with GDP as the least influential factor. Within a certain range, the three-dimensional landscape pattern metrics increased with larger population density in the social factors, and decreased with lower rate of NDVI and water surface ratio in the environmental factors. Our results demonstrated that the BRT method was effective in quantifying the interaction between landscape pattern and social-environmental factors.

To cater to this, there is a need to develop and implement real-time flood management systems that could instantly detect flooded regions to initiate relief activities as early as possible. Current imaging systems, relying on satellites, have demonstrated low accuracy and delayed response, making them unreliable and impractical to be used in emergency responses to natural disasters such as flooding. This research employs Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to develop an automated imaging system that can identify inundated areas from aerial images. The Haar cascade classifier was explored in the case study to detect landmarks such as roads and buildings from the aerial images captured by UAVs and identify flooded areas. The extracted landmarks are added to the training dataset that is used to train a deep learning algorithm. Experimental results show that buildings and roads can be detected from the images with 91% and 94% accuracy, respectively. The overall accuracy of 91% is recorded in classifying flooded and non-flooded regions from the input case study images. The system has shown promising results on test images belonging to both pre-and post-flood classes. The flood relief and rescue workers can quickly locate flooded regions and rescue stranded people using this system. Such real-time flood inundation systems will help transform the disaster management systems in line with modern smart cities initiatives. © 2021 by the authors.

To be effective, the HAEMS should include various electrical appliances as well as local distributed/renewable energy resources and energy storage systems, with the whole system as a microgrid. However, the collecting and processing of the data associated with these appliances/resources are challenging in terms of the required sensors/communication infrastructure and computational burden. Thanks to the internet-of-things and cloud computing technologies, the physical requirements for handling the data have been provided; however, they demand suitable optimization/management schemes. In this article, a HAEMS is developed using cloud services to increase the accuracy and speed of the data processing. A management protocol is proposed that provides an optimal schedule for a day-ahead operation of the electrical equipment of smart residential homes under welfare indicators. The proposed system comprises three layers: (1) sensors associated with the home appliances and generation/storage units, (2) local fog nodes, and (3) a cloud where the information is processed bilaterally with HAEMS and the hourly optimal operation of appliances/generation/storage units is planned. The neural network and genetic algorithm (GA) are used as part of the HAEMS program. The neural network is used to predict the amount of workload corresponding to users’ requests. Improving the load factor and the economic efficiency are considered as the objective function that is optimized using GA.

As the results showed, the Built-up area class increased, while the forest (Semi forest and Dense forest) classes decreased during the period from 1999 to 2019. The predicted scenario showed a considerable increase of about 60 % in the Built-up area until 2039. The vegetation plant areas consist about 47 % of all the area in 2019, but it will be 36 % in 2039, if this trend (urban expansion) continues in the further.

With the development of computer technology, artificial intelligence, especially reinforcement learning, plays an increasingly important role in traffic signal control. Currently, traffic signal control based on reinforcement learning is mainly used for the optimization for simple scenarios, such as single road intersection or urban arterial road, not yet for regional coordinated control on an urban geographic road network. This paper is motivated to fill this gap by proposing a two-layered agent cooperative control approach based on reinforcement learning. The first layer implements a coarse-tuning training at a single intersection, where the agents make the single intersection non-blocking by observing the queue length for each lane; In the second layer, the coarse-tuning-trained agent models are put into the geographic network to execute the cooperative fine-tuning training at multiple intersections. This paper conducts the optimization-orientated traffic coordination through a case study of a middle school area in Ningbo. The results show that our control approach is superior to the traditional fixed timing scheme in terms of the passage efficiency. © 2021, Surveying and Mapping Press.

Therefore, up-to-date building maps have become vital for many applications, including urban mapping and urban expansion analysis. With the development of deep learning, segmenting building footprints from high-resolution remote sensing imagery has become a subject of intense study. Here, a modified version of the U-Net architecture with a combination of pre-and post-processing techniques was developed to extract building footprints from high-resolution aerial imagery and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery. Data pre-processing with the logarithmic correction image enhancing algorithm showed the most significant improvement in the building detection accuracy for aerial images; meanwhile, the CLAHE algorithm improved the most concerning UAV images. This study developed a post-processing technique using polygonizing and polygon smoothing called the Douglas–Peucker algorithm, which made the building output directly ready to use for different applications.

Three distinct themes are inspected and interrelated to develop awareness for an urbanizing world: Internal urban design and innovation, technical transition, and geopolitical change. Data were collected on the use of energy in cities and, by extension, nation states over the last 30 years. The urban population boom continues to pressure the energy dimension with heavily weighted impacts on less developed regions. Sustainable urban energy will need to reduce resource inputs and environmental impacts and decouple economic growth from energy consumption. Fossil fuels continue to be the preferred method of energy for cities; however, an increased understanding is emerging that sustainable energy forms can be implemented as alternatives. Key to this transition will be the will to invest in renewables (i.e., solar, wind, hydro, tidal, geothermal, and biomass), efficient infrastructure, and smart eco-city designs. This essay elucidates how the technical transition of energy-friendly technologies focuses on understanding the changes in the energy mix from non-renewable to renewable. Smart electricity storage grids with artificial intelligence can operate internationally and alleviate some geopolitical barriers. Energy politics is shown to be a problematic hurdle with case research examples specific to Central and Eastern Europe.

Connectivity parameters are essential in the analysis of connectivity of various kinds of networks. In graphs, the strength of a cycle is always one. But, in a fuzzy incidence graph (FIG), the strengths of cycles may vary even for a given pair of vertices. Cyclic reachability is an attribute that decides the overall connectedness of any network. In graph the cycle connectivity (CC) from vertex a to vertex b and from vertex b to vertex a is always one. In fuzzy graph (FG) the CC from vertex a to vertex b and from vertex b to vertex a is always same. But if someone is interested in finding CC from vertex a to an edge ab, then graphs and FGs cannot answer this question. Therefore, in this research article, we proposed the idea of CC for FIG. Because in FIG, we can find CC from vertex a to vertex b and also from vertex a to an edge ab. Also, we proposed the idea of CC of fuzzy incidence cycles (FICs) and complete fuzzy incidence graphs (CFIGs). The fuzzy incidence cyclic cut-vertex, fuzzy incidence cyclic bridge, and fuzzy incidence cyclic cut pair are established. A condition for CFIG to have fuzzy incidence cyclic cut-vertex is examined. Cyclic connectivity index and average cyclic connectivity index of FIG are also investigated. Three different types of vertices, such as cyclic connectivity increasing vertex, cyclically neutral vertex and, cyclic connectivity decreasing vertex, are also defined.

Therefore, in order to protect the ecological environment, regulate urban development and pursue the maximization of ecological benefits, it is necessary to analyze, simulate and predict land use change. In this study, Hengyang City was taken as the study area, and based on the current land use data of Hengyang City in 2010, 2015, and 2018, the land use type transfer during 2010–2015 and 2015–2018 was analyzed. Then, starting from 2010, the FLUS model was used to simulate the spatial distribution of land use in 2015 and 2018, and then the spatial distribution of land use in Hengyang City in 2025 was predicted with the Markov prediction method under the premise of ecological protection priority. The results show that the change in ecological land in Hengyang City is mainly distributed in the surrounding and marginal areas, because the topography of Hengyang City is a basin. Changes in land type in Hengyang City in 2015 were subtle and difficult to observe. However, in 2018, the transformation of non-ecological land into ecological land was obvious, and the distribution area of ecological land expanded significantly. The Kappa index of the results simulated by the FLUS model based on neural network is above 0.72, and overall accuracy is above 0.9, which is highly consistent with the actual situation. It is reasonable and convincing to predict the spatial distribution of land use in the context of ecological protection. The predicted results can be useful for urban planning and land use distribution and provide a reference for relevant decision-makers. © 2021 by the authors.

Accident-risk mapping with machine learning algorithms in the geographic information system (GIS) platform is a suitable approach for investigating the occurrence risk of these accidents by analyzing the role of effective factors. This approach helps to identify the high-risk areas even in unnoticed and remote places and prioritizes accident-prone locations. This paper aimed to evaluate tuned machine learning algorithms of bagged decision trees (BDTs), extra trees (ETs), and random forest (RF) in accident-risk mapping caused by drivers’ lack of alertness (due to drowsiness, fatigue, and reduced attention) at a national scale of Iran roads. Accident points and eight effective criteria, namely distance to the city, distance to the gas station, land use/cover, road structure, road type, time of day, traffic direction, and slope, were applied in modeling, using GIS. The time factor was utilized to represent drivers’ varied alertness levels. The accident dataset included 4399 RTA records from March 2017 to March 2019. The performance of all models was cross-validated with five-folds and tree metrics of mean absolute error, mean squared error, and area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC-AUC). The results of cross-validation showed that BDT and RF performance with an AUC of 0.846 were slightly more accurate than ET with an AUC of 0.827. The importance of modeling features was assessed by using the Gini index, and the results revealed that the road type, distance to the city, distance to the gas station, slope, and time of day were the most important, while land use/cover, traffic direction, and road structure were the least important. The proposed approach can be improved by applying the traffic volume in modeling and helps decision-makers take necessary actions by identifying important factors on road safety. © 2021 by the authors.

The optimum time intervals or panel movement can change the rate of input energy to the panel surface in Iran. For this purpose, a neural network has been trained to estimate the intensity of solar radiation in Iran. After model validation, the intensity of solar radiation has been estimated by selecting adequate geographical regions. Based on the intensity of sunlight, Iran has been divided into ten regions. In these regions, 40 cities have been randomly selected to study the effect of the panel’s angle variations within appropriate time inter-vals, as well as equal time intervals. The results show that the choice of the mounting system with the possibility of five angles’ implementation can increase the amount of solar energy between 3.9% and 7.4%. Compared to this number of angles at the equal time intervals, the amount of incoming solar energy has increased by 3% to 7%. In the first and second cases, the area of the power plant increases by about 12% to 24% compared to the yearly optimum tilt angle. Moreover, the amount of radiation incoming to the panel with the optimum operating angle is in alignment with the results of PVsyst software. © 2021 by the authors.

Many network applications have been developed in every domain of life, including business, healthcare, smart homes, and smart cities, to name a few. As these network applications provide a wide range of services for large user groups, the network intruders are prone to developing intrusion skills for attack and malicious compliance. Therefore, safeguarding network applications and things connected to the internet has always been a point of interest for researchers. Many studies propose solutions for intrusion detection systems and intrusion prevention systems. Network communities have produced benchmark datasets available for researchers to improve the accuracy of intrusion detection systems. The scientific community has presented data mining and machine learning-based mechanisms to detect intrusion with high classification accuracy. This paper presents an intrusion detection system based on the ensemble of prediction and learning mechanisms to improve anomaly detection accuracy in a network intrusion environment. The learning mechanism is based on automated machine learning, and the prediction model is based on the Kalman filter. Performance analysis of the proposed intrusion detection system is evaluated using publicly available intrusion datasets UNSW-NB15 and CICIDS2017. The proposed model-based intrusion detection accuracy for the UNSW-NB15 dataset is 98.801 percent, and the CICIDS2017 dataset is 97.02 percent. The performance comparison results show that the proposed ensemble model-based intrusion detection significantly improves the intrusion detection accuracy. © 2021 by the authors.

Such an application, however, demands the use of trained machine learning classifiers in order to categorize a limited set of audio categories. Although classical machine learning solutions have been proposed in the past, most of the latest solutions that have been proposed toward automated and accurate sound classification are based on a deep learning approach. Deep learning models tend to be large, which can be problematic when considering that sound classifiers often have to be embedded in resource constrained devices. In this paper, a classical machine learning based classifier called MosAIc, and a lighter Convolutional Neural Network model for environmental sound recognition, are proposed to directly compete in terms of accuracy with the latest deep learning solutions. Both approaches are evaluated in an embedded system in order to identify the key parameters when placing such applications on constrained devices. The experimental results show that classical machine learning classifiers can be combined to achieve similar results to deep learning models, and even outperform them in accuracy. The cost, however, is a larger classification time. © 2021 by the authors.

Many real-time solutions are giving benefits to both patients and professionals for remote data accessibility and suitable actions. However, timely medical decisions and efficient management of big data using IoT-based resources are the burning research challenges. Additionally, the distributed nature of data processing in many proposed solutions explicitly increases the threats of information leakages and damages the network integrity. Such solutions impose overhead on medical sensors and decrease the stability of the real-time transmission systems. Therefore, this paper presents a machine-learning model with SDN-enabled security to predict the consumption of network resources and improve the delivery of sensors data. Additionally, it offers centralized-based software define network (SDN) architecture to overcome the network threats among deployed sensors with nominal management cost. Firstly, it offers an unsupervised machine learning technique and decreases the communication overheads for IoT networks. Secondly, it predicts the link status using dynamic metrics and refines its strategies using SDN architecture. In the end, a security algorithm is utilized by the SDN controller that efficiently manages the consumption of the IoT nodes and protects it from unidentified occur-rences. The proposed model is verified using simulations and improves system performance in terms of network throughput by 13%, data drop ratio by 39%, data delay by 11%, and faulty pack-ets by 46% compared to HUNA and CMMA schemes. © 2021 by the authors.

The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals also require the accurate and timely assessment of where people live to formulate, implement, and monitor sustainable development policies. However, due to the lack of appropriate auxiliary datasets and effective methodological frameworks, there are rarely continuous multi-temporal gridded population data over a long historical period to aid in our understanding of the spatiotemporal evolution of the population. In this study, we developed a framework integrating a ResNet-N deep learning architecture, considering neighborhood effects with a vast number of Landsat-5 images from Google Earth Engine for population mapping, to overcome both the data and methodology obstacles associated with rapid multi-temporal population mapping over a long historical period at a large scale. Using this proposed framework in China, we mapped fine-scale multi-temporal gridded population data (1 km × 1 km) of China for the 1985–2010 period with a 5-year interval. The produced multi-temporal population data were validated with available census data and achieved comparable performance. By analyzing the multi-temporal population grids, we revealed the spatiotemporal evolution of population distribution from 1985 to 2010 in China with the characteristic of concentration of the population in big cities and the contraction of small-and medium-sized cities. The framework proposed in this study demonstrates the feasibility of mapping multi-temporal gridded population distribution at a large scale over a long period in a timely and low-cost manner, which is particularly useful in low-income and data-poor areas. © 2021 by the authors.

Besides enabling the auto-mated collection of consumers’ electric energy consumption data for billing purposes, data gathered by smart meters and analyzed through Artificial Intelligence (AI) make the realization of consumer-centric use cases possible. A smart meter installed in a domestic sector of an electrical grid and used for the realization of consumer-centric use cases is located at the entry point of a household/build-ing’s electrical grid connection and can gather composite/circuit-level electric energy consumption data. However, it is not able to decompose its measured circuit-level electric energy consumption into appliance-level electric energy consumption.

A necessary condition is to determine which specific repetitive behaviors and features smart cities will have to meet in order to build an image among residents and adapt to their preferences and requirements and energy requirements. Smart cities were created to support residents in using various services, to give them the possibility of easy communication without time and local barriers. Therefore, high-quality smart solutions in cities significantly affect trust in the city and can affect its reputation. Given that the purpose of the article is to examine the perception of intelligent solutions also in the field of energy and their impact on the sense of privacy and security, different exchanges of perceptions of quality, the risks they pose to residents and their perception of what gives a picture, have been studied. The results of empirical research clearly showed that the safety and level of satisfaction with the activities carried out by the city have a significant impact on the perceived quality, which in turn has a positive impact on reputation. The authors proposed a methodology based on the Kano model for examining residents’ satisfaction in order to investigate undefined desires and identified and confirmed needs and to study the analysis of risk and potential threats. The study was in the form of a proprietary questionnaire that can be used in similar surveys on the satisfaction of residents; 2685 correctly completed questionnaires were analyzed and the results obtained after submission were included in management action plans. The city government has expressed an interest that the measures taken will be reviewed after one to two years. © 2021 by the authors.

However, state-of-the-art image-based automatic 3D reconstruction methods cannot effectively handle the unavoidable geometric deformation and incorrect texture mapping problems caused by moving cars in a city. This paper proposes a method to address this situation and prevent the influence of moving cars on 3D modelling by recognizing moving cars and combining the recognition results with a photogrammetric 3D modelling procedure. Through car detection using a deep learning method and multiview geometry constraints, we can analyse the state of a car’s movement and apply a proper preprocessing method to the geometrically model generation and texture mapping steps of 3D reconstruction pipelines. First, we apply the traditional Mask R-CNN object detection method to detect cars from oblique images. Then, a detected car and its corresponding image patch calculated by the geometry constraints in the other view images are used to identify the moving state of the car. Finally, the geometry and texture information corresponding to the moving car will be processed according to its moving state. Experiments on three different urban datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in recognizing and removing moving cars and can repair the geometric deformation and error texture mapping problems caused by moving cars. In addition, the methods proposed in this paper can be applied to eliminate other moving objects in 3D modelling applications. © 2021 by the authors.

GI has the potential to make significant contributions to make cities more sustainable by satisfying the growing appetite for higher standards of living as well as helping cities adapt to extreme climate events. To leverage the potentials of GI, this article aims to investigate the effectiveness of GI that can enhance social welfare benefits in the triple-bottom line of urban sustainability. First, publicly available data sets representing social demographic, climate, and built environmental elements are collected and indexed to normalize its different scales by the elements, which is termed as the “Social Well-being Index.” Second, a random forest regressor was applied to identify the impacts of variables on the indexed scores by region. As a result, both the Seoul and Gyeonggi-do models found the most significant relationship with the type of GI to prevent pollutants and disasters, followed by GI types to conserve and improve the environment in Seoul and GI types to serve activity spaces in Gyeonggi-do. Furthermore, variables such as population, number of pollutants, and employment rate in Seoul were found significant and employment rate, population, and air pollution were significant in Gyeonggi-do. Finally, a scenario analysis is conducted to investigate the impacts of the overall index score with additional GI facilitation according to the model’s findings. This article can provide effective strategies for implementing policies about GI by considering regional conditions. The analytical processes in this article can provide useful insights into preparing effective ecological and environmental improvement policies accordingly. © 2021 by the authors.

Buildings are the most prominent features in the urban environment, and are necessary for urban decision support; thus, buildings should be modeled effectively and efficiently in three dimensions (3D). In this study, with the help of Gaofen-7 (GF-7) high-resolution stereo mapping satellite double-line camera (DLC) images and multispectral (MUX) images, the boundary of a building is seg-mented via a multilevel features fusion network (MFFN). A digital surface model (DSM) is gener-ated to obtain the elevation of buildings. The building vector with height information is processed using a 3D modeling tool to create a white building model. The building model, DSM, and multi-spectral fused image are then imported into the Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) to complete the urban scene level, vividly rendered with environmental effects for urban visualization. The results of this study show that high accuracy of 95.29% is achieved in building extraction using our proposed method. Based on the extracted building vector and elevation information from the DSM, building 3D models can be efficiently created in Level of Details 1 (LOD1). Finally, the urban scene is produced for realistic 3D visualization. This study shows that high-resolution stereo mapping satellite images are useful in 3D modeling for urban buildings and can support the generation and visualization of urban scenes in a large area for different applications. © 2021 by the authors.

First, a preliminary analysis of the current state of innovation and development of China’s nine urban agglomerations was con-ducted. Then the Theil index, widely used in equilibrium research, was employed to measure the overall innovation gap of China’s urban agglomerations. The study innovatively used the self-or-ganizing feature map to identify the correlation characteristics of the innovation and development within China’s urban agglomerations and visualize them through Geographic Information Science. The research findings show that the hierarchical differentiation of the innovation and development of China’s urban agglomerations is becoming increasingly clear, and that the imbalance in regional innovation development is pronounced. The imbalance in innovation development within urban agglomerations is more significant than the imbalance in innovation development among urban agglomerations. The analysis indicated that a possible cause is the crowding effect and administra-tive standard effect of the central city. The key to addressing this problem is promoting innovative and coordinated development between regions. © 2021 by the author.

The support vector machine (SVM) was used to classify LULC maps over the years 1990–2018, and their dynamics were examined using delta change and a Markovian transitional probability matrix (TPM). From 1990 to 2018, the ESV was calculated for each LULC type using a coefficient. An artificial neural network-cellular automata model was used to predict the future LULC map for 2028. Sensitivity analysis has been performed using the probability distribution function, Pearson’s correlation methods, random forest, and classification and regression tree. Future LULC was used to derive future ESV from different ecosystems. The results of LULC maps showed that urban areas rose by 334.4% between 1990 and 2018. Delta change rate showed that urban areas have increased by 16.34% since 1990, while the TPM for the period of 1990–2018 reported that the built-up area was the largest stable LULC with a TPM value of 83.6%, while agricultural land, scrubland, exposed rocks, and water bodies were converted by 17.9%, 21.8%, 12.4%, and 10.5%, respectively, into built-up areas. Due to the accelerated and continuous urbanization process, all-natural resources and ecosystem services have been diminished considerably except for dense vegetation. The future LULC map of 2028 showed that the built-up area would be 343.72 km2, followed by scrubland (342.98 km2). The new urban area in 2028 would be 169 km2. The sensitivity analysis showed that proximity to the urban area, vegetation, and scrubland are highly sensitive to simulating and predicting the LULC maps of 2018 and 2028.

We model city areas using a hierarchical structure of POIs extracted from foursquare. We encode such structures in kernel machines, e.g., Support Vector Machines, using a new Tree Kernel, i.e., the Hierarchical POI Kernel (HPK), which can take the importance of the individual POIs into account during the substructure matching. This way, HPK projects structures in the space of all their possible substructures such that each dimension corresponds to a semantic structural feature, weighted according to the discriminative power of POIs. We generated four different datasets for the following cities: Barcelona, Lisbon, Amsterdam and Milan, where we trained and tested our models. The results show that our approach largely outperforms previous work and standard baseline built on simple features, such as counts of different POIs. Finally, we apply a mining algorithm to extract the most relevant features (tree fragments) from the implicit TK space according to the weights the kernel machine assigned to them. Our approach can produce an explicit set of representative features that can be used to classify and characterize urban areas. © 1989-2012 IEEE.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112762012,Yes,Italy,Land Use,Urban Planning & Land Use,Urban Development & Land Use,"SVM, Tree Kernel",Classification,Classify land use zones using POI hierarchical structures and kernel machines,SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities),Methodological,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Weak

The terrestrial infrastructure presents itself as a preeminent component in this change. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) empowered with artificial intelligence (AI) are expected to become an integral component of future smart cities that provide seamless coverage for vehicles on highways with poor cellular infrastructure. Motivated by the above, in this paper, we introduce UAVs cell-free network for providing coverage to vehicles entering a highway that is not covered by other infrastructure. However, UAVs have limited energy resources and cannot serve the entire highway all the time. Furthermore, the deployed UAVs have insufficient knowledge about the environment (e.g., the vehicles' instantaneous location). Therefore, it is challenging to control a swarm of UAVs to achieve efficient communication coverage. To address these challenges, we formulate the trajectories decisions making as a Markov decision process (MDP) where the system state space considers the vehicular network dynamics. Then, we leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to propose an approach for learning the optimal trajectories of the deployed UAVs to efficiently maximize the vehicular coverage, where we adopt Actor-Critic algorithm to learn the vehicular environment and its dynamics to handle the complex continuous action space. Finally, simulations results are provided to verify our findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design and show that during the mission time, the deployed UAVs adapt their velocities in order to cover the vehicles. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",This work was supported in part by the Concordia University and in part by FQRNT.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112726642,Yes,Canada,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,Deep Reinforcement Learning,Optimization,Leverage UAVs for coverage in cell-free vehicular networks using deep RL,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

However, it is not easy to make significant changes in a city while building a transportation system, and the transit-guided urban development expected by the TOD concept has not been completely realized. The transformation of nearby areas with the guidance of transit is also becoming the choice of many Chinese cities, especially for cities that have only had subways for a few years. Unlike other international metropolitan cities, with metro systems of considerable scale, the modernization process of most of the small and medium-sized cities in China is being carried out simultaneously with metro-based public transportation guidance. For cities which are still in their initial stage of the backbone public transportation system, there is not enough previous experience and evidence to support the suitability of TOD typological analysis based on the node-place model. More research based on the node-place model has also shown practical applications of the TOD in developed cities. However, there are very few studies that analyse cities in which rail transit and urban development are both in a period of rapid growth. The goal of this research is to identify which metro stations in these cities are suitable for TOD improvement and optimization. This article attempts to expand the willingness of residents on the basis of the traditional node-place model as one of the judgment indicators for evaluating whether existing stations and surrounding areas are suitable for TOD improvement. At the same time, traditional statistical analysis is combined with GIS and machine learning technology. Using this method, we propose the TOD improvement-oriented station area classification and identification method based on TOD typology theory. The results show that Ningbo's subway stations can be divided into four categories according to the suitability for TOD improvement, and we selected seven stations suitable for TOD improvement according to the characteristics of the node-place model. The practice in Ningbo has proved that this method is effective for identifying sites suitable for TOD improvement, especially for cities that have recently built subways. © 2021, The Author(s).","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the GEF China Sustainable Cities Integrated Approach Pilot (project number: P156507).

In recent years, machine-learning techniques have become very popular for producing landslide susceptibility maps. This study aims to compare the performance of these machine learning models with the traditional statistical methods used to produce landslide susceptibility maps. The landslide susceptibility for Ardanuc, Turkey was evaluated using three models: logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF). Ten parameters that are effective in landslide occurrence are used in this study. The accuracy and prediction capabilities of the models were assessed using both the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) methods. According to the AUC method, the success rate of the LR, SVM, and RF models was 83.1%, 93.2%, and 98.3%, respectively. Further, the prediction rates were calculated as 82.9% (LR), 92.8% (SVM), and 97.7% (RF). According to the verification results, RF and SVM models outperformed the traditional LR model in terms of success and prediction rate. The RF model, however, performed better than the SVM model in terms of success and prediction rates. The landslide susceptibility maps produced as a result of this study can guide city planners, local administrators, and public institutions related to disaster management to prevent and reduce landslide hazards. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",This study was supported by the Scientific Research Projects Office of Artvin Çoruh University (AÇÜBAP) (Scientific Research Project No. 2019.

In the previous studies on OWC, location-based units such as a single station, station cluster, and land parcel were generally used as the basic analysis units for demand; however, these studies failed to consider the association among the operating areas. This led to results that were pertinent to a specific OWC system and cross-section of the development process. The objective of this study is to explore the significant factors related to flow-based demand (i.e., four-weekly bookings from the origin spatial unit to the destination spatial unit (OD bookings)). Four groups of explanatory variables are adopted: carsharing spatial unit attributes, built environment, transportation facilities, and OD trip attributes (such as public transportation and car travel distance between the OD). A combination model integrating machine learning and a generalized linear model is also developed to address the zero-inflation issue of the data. Moreover, an approach of Shapley additive explanations is implemented to determine the considerable effects of the factors. The results show that (1) the OD trip attributes play an important role in estimating the carsharing OD demand; (2) taxi and carsharing demands exhibit a non-significant partial overlap, and carsharing may compete with buses and supplement to the metro; and (3) the travel purpose in carsharing is diverse for any land use over a four-week period. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank the Shanghai International Automobile City Co.

The Spatial Convolution Layer proposed in this paper captures the spatial correlation features of the graph structure. The special Graph Data Fusion module distributes and fuses the two kinds of data according to different proportions to increase the trend of spatial correlation of the data. In order to reduce the complexity of the computational process, the Temporal Convolution Layer replaces the gated recursive mechanism of the traditional recurrent neural network with a multi-level residual structure. It uses the dilated convolution whose dilation factor changes according to convex function to control the dynamic change of the receptive field and uses causal convolution to fully mine the historical information of the data to optimize the ability of long-term prediction. The comparative experiments among DeepTRI and three baselines (traditional recurrent neural network, ordinary spatial–temporal model and graph spatial–temporal model) show the advantages of DeepTRI in the evaluation index and resolving two under-fitting problems (under-fitting of edge values and under-fitting of local peaks). © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","The code of DeepTRI code is open sourced at https://github.com/qdu318/DeepTRI.git .

The study utilized big data including Automated Traffic Signal Performance Measures (ATSPM) data, crowdsourced data (Strava), Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) surveillance camera videos, crash data, traffic information, roadway features, land use attributes, and socio-demographic characteristics. It comprises an extensive comparison between a wide array of statistical and machine learning models that were developed to estimate pedestrian and bike exposure. The results indicated that the XGBoost approach was the best to estimate vulnerable road users’ exposure at intersections as well as bike exposure along the roadway segments. Afterwards, the estimated exposure was utilized as input variables to develop crash prediction models that relate different crash types to potential explanatory variables. Negative Binomial approach was followed to develop crash prediction models to be consistent with the Highway Safety Manual. The results show that the exposure variables (i.e., AADT, bike exposure, and the interaction between them) have significant influences on the two types of crashes (i.e., crashes of vulnerable road users at intersections and bike crashes along the segments). Further, the results indicated that the context classification is significantly related to crashes. Based on the developed models, the PSIs were calculated and the hotspots were identified for the two crash types. It was found that hotspots were more likely to be located near the city of Orlando. Coastal roadways were classified as cold categories regarding bike crashes. Further, C4 roadway segments were found to be significantly related to the increase of vulnerable road users’ crashes at intersections and bike crashes along the segments. © 2021",The research discussed in this paper was funded by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT).,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85109449114,Yes,United States,Safety/Crime,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,Machine Learning,Classification,Identify vulnerable road users crash hotspots on arterial roads using estimated exposure and ML,"SDG 3 (Health), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

By considering the significance of the security requirement in smart city applications connected with the Internet of Things, this manuscript introduces a rational attribute-based data fusion trust model. The proposed trust model relies on different timely attributes for identifying the reputation of the available service. This reputation is computed as the accumulative factor of trust observed at different times and details. The attributes and the uncertain characteristics of the service provider in the successive sharing instances are recurrently analyzed using deep machine learning to fuse uncertain-less data. This data fusion method reduces the uncertainties in estimating the precise trust during different application responses and service dissemination.

However, the extreme UHI (E-UHI) formed in factory areas deserves more attention. To mitigate the E-UHI, machine learning is used for simulating and quantifying the marginal utility of the scale, shape, type, stage, and structure of the factory on the land surface temperature (LST), factory LST (LST<inf>f</inf>), surrounding LST (LST<inf>s</inf>) and increase value (ΔLST) level. The results show that the scale of all types of factories affects LST<inf>f</inf> and LST<inf>s</inf>, and the shape of steel factories affects LST<inf>s</inf> and ΔLST. The LST in factories that require high-temperature environments (e.g., smelters) is significantly higher than that in other factories (e.g., sales plants). The ΔLST of green space (GS), staff activity ground (SG), material transfer ground (MG), material storage area (MA), factory building (FB), smelting area (SA) and casting building (CB) are 3.95 °C, 4.01 °C, 5.08 °C, 5.15 °C, 5.24 °C, 5.49 °C and 7.32 °C, and their optimal ranges are 8.84%–15.09%, 16.65%–25.52%, 3.91%–35.91%, 0.00%–8.70%, 5.06%–13.60%, 23.33%–48.02%, and 0.00%–5.73%, respectively. Appropriately standardizing the scale and shape, controlling the temperature of the high-temperature generation stage, reducing the proportion of CB, MG and MA, and increasing the proportion of GS and SG are effective ways to alleviate the E-UHI. The findings provide theoretical guidance for resource-based cities to mitigate E-UHIs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No: 41971260 ) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No: 2652018033 ).

A geospatial simulation framework is presented to assess and evaluate densification potentials at the neighbourhood level of already built-up residential areas. The focus is on post-war neighbourhoods, which are particularly promising for sustainable densification. Neighbourhoods are localised using geospatial analysis and based on literature and architectural designs, potentials are estimated for different neighbourhood archetypes and densification strategies. Potentials are simulated at a national scale using supervised archetype classification. The embeddedness into current mobility infrastructure is used as a proxy for evaluating the sustainability of neighbourhood densification. The developed framework is tested for Switzerland. Depending on the densification strategy, the simulated additional inhabitants for populating post-war urban neighbourhoods range between 4–15 % of the current population. More than half of this potential is located in central areas and is well connected by public transportation. The presented approach is suitable for assessing spatially explicit densification potential and for prioritising densification locations.

The proper operation of semantic segmentation for remote sensing images remains challenging due to the complex and diverse transitions between different ground areas. Although several convolution neural networks (CNNs) have been developed for remote sensing semantic segmentation, the performance of CNNs is far from the expected target. This study presents a deep feature aggregation network (DFANet) for remote sensing image semantic segmentation. It is composed of a basic feature representation layer, an intermediate feature aggregation layer, a deep feature aggregation layer and a feature aggregation module (FAM). Specially, the basic feature representation layer is used to obtain feature maps with different resolutions: the intermediate feature aggregation layer and deep feature aggregation layer can fuse various resolution features and multi-scale features; the FAM is used to splice the features and form more abundant spatial feature maps; and the conditional random field module is used to optimize semantic segmentation results. We have performed extensive experiments on the ISPRS two-dimensional Vaihingen and Potsdam remote sensing image datasets and compared the proposed method with several variations of semantic segmentation networks.

However, three important challenges need to be addressed to attain long term healthcare-related sustainability – data security, data privacy, and social acceptance of deep learning process. In this paper, we propose a framework that will allow healthcare sustainability through the following contributions 1) ensure privacy of training dataset, 2) support the aggregation of the global model gradients through a private Blockchain-brokered entity, 3) support trustworthiness and provenance of the federated clients by blockchain and off-chain, 4) share the dataset, train the model and share trained model among the federated clients in an encrypted fashion, and 5) add explainability and reasoning of deep learning process to make the model acceptable by the society.

Exploring the interaction and coupling effects within the Economy–Society–Environment (ESE) system in urban agglomeration areas is conducive to promoting high-quality sustainable urban development. Based on systems theory, we constructed an ESE system with multiple elements, information and interaction flows. Taking the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA) in the period from 2010 to 2018 as a research sample, we used the Entropy Method (EM) and the Coupling Coordination Degree Model (CCDM) to synthetically evaluate the coupling coordination degree of the ESE system. The Back-Propagation Artificial Neural Network (BPANN) was applied to explore the influencing factors of the ESE system's coupling coordination degree considering the nonlinear relationship between the various indicators and the ESE system's coupling coordination degree. The main results can be summarized as follows. (1) The coupling coordination degree of the ESE system and the comprehensive quality of its subsystems in the YRDUA showed trends of growth during 2010–2018. There were obvious spatial differences: Shanghai had the highest quality scores, Jiangsu and Zhejiang had medium values, and Anhui had the lowest scores. However, these disparities continued to decrease during the study period. The overall coupling coordination degree distribution presents a normal distribution shape, most of cities concentrated in the moderate coordination grade. (2) At present, the coupling coordination of the society-environment binary system makes a great contribution to the ESE ternary system. (3) The comprehensive quality of the economy provides strong support for sustainable social and environmental development. (4) Factors such as the urbanization rate, proportion of tertiary industry in GDP, per-capita retail sales of consumer goods are critical to the coordinated development of the ESE system. © 2021",This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 41771181 ).,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107727053,Yes,China,Environment,Disaster Management,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,"Entropy Method, Coupling Model",Not Specified,Explore coupling effects in Economy-Society-Environment system in Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration,SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities),Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Longitudinal,Strong

Traffic forecasting allows drivers to select the fastest route towards their target destinations. A prerequisite for traffic flow management is accurate traffic forecasting. In this study, we introduce a framework for traffic forecasting that uses data on air pollution. The reason to select that data is air pollution rates are often associated with traffic congestion, and there is intensive research that exists to forecast air pollution by road traffic. To the best of our knowledge, any effort to enhance road traffic prediction through air quality and ensemble regression model techniques is not yet been proposed. In this research, our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we have performed a comparative analysis of 7 different regression models to find out which model gives better accuracy. Secondly, we propose a framework using regression models in which the first regression model's result is boosted using boosting ensemble method and is passed to the next regression model which shows that the proposed framework gives more satisfying results than the above 7 regression models.

Creating a higher degree of communication in automobiles results in the time wastage, fuel wastage, environmental damage, and even death caused by citizens being trapped in the middle of traffic. Only a few researchers work in traffic congestion prediction and control systems, but it may provide less accuracy. So, this paper proposed an efficient IoT-based traffic prediction using OWENN algorithm and traffic signal control system using Intel 80,286 microprocessor for a smart city. The proposed system consists of ‘5’ phases, namely IoT data collection, feature extraction, classification, optimized traffic IoT values, and traffic signal control system. Initially, the IoT traffic data are collected from the dataset. After that, traffic, weather, and direction information are extracted, and these extracted features are given as input to the OWENN classifier, which classifies which place has more traffic. Suppose one direction of the place has more traffic, it optimizes the IoT values by using IBSO, and finally, the traffic is controlled by using Intel 80,286 microprocessor. An efficient OWENN algorithm for traffic prediction and traffic signal control using a Intel 80,286 microprocessor for a smart city. After extracting the features, the classification is performed in this step. Hereabout, the classification is done by using the optimized weight Elman neural network (OWENN) algorithm that classifies which places have more traffic. OWENN attains 98.23% accuracy than existing model also its achieved 96.69% F-score than existing model.

Smart cities’ paradigm has resulted in improved quality of life and better services to citizens, like smart healthcare, smart parking, smart transport, smart buildings, smart homes, and so on. One of the major challenges of IoT devices is the limited capacity of their battery because the devices consume a large amount of energy once they communicate with each other. Furthermore, the IoT-based smart systems would contain sensitive data about network systems, introducing serious privacy and security issues. IoT-based smart systems are highly exposed to botnet attacks. Examples of such attacks are Mirai and BASHLITE malware launched from compromised surveillance devices, which are common in smart cities, resulting in paralysis of Internet-based services through distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Such DDoS attacks on IoT devices and their networks further threaten the emerging concept of sustainable smart cities. To discover such cyberattacks, this paper proposes a novel statistical learning-based botnet detection framework, called IoTBoT-IDS, which protects IoT-based smart networks against botnet attacks. IoTBoT-IDS captures the normal behavior of IoT networks by applying statistical learning-based techniques, using Beta Mixture Model (BMM) and a Correntropy model. Any deviation from the normal behavior is detected as an anomalous event. To evaluate IoTBoT-IDS, three benchmark datasets generated from realistic IoT networks were used. The evaluation results showed that IoTBoT-IDS effectively identifies various types of botnets with an average detection accuracy of 99.2%, which is higher by about 2–5% compared with compelling intrusion detection methods, namely AdaBoost ensemble learning, fuzzy c-means, and deep feed forward neural networks. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107301135,Yes,Pakistan,Safety/Crime,Security & Safety,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Statistical Learning,Classification,Develop IoTBoT-IDS framework for botnet detection protecting networks of smart cities,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

In this study, we propose to tackle a novel transit mobility structure detection problem, which hinges on high-level mobility patterns that characterize collective movement dynamics across the study region. To this end, we propose a machine learning-based approach to discover meaningful urban mobility structure using big transit data. We contend that both transit mobility patterns and local urban function information should be considered during the detection of transit mobility structure. By integrating different sources of urban data, we model the network of transit mobility as an attributed graph: local static urban functions are described by attributed features for graph nodes whereas travel dynamics are captured via a transit mobility pattern matrix. Similarities of both attributed features and transit mobility patterns are jointly embedded to derive compact low-dimensional vector representations via graph auto-encoder. Mobility structure is then extracted using unsupervised clustering and gap statistics. The proposed approach is capable of synthesizing both mobility and static information in a data-driven manner, preserving original urban topological structure and resident movement dynamics. The proposed approach was evaluated using real-world transit data collected in Shenzhen City, China. Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that the proposed approach has the applicability of unveiling meaningful transit mobility structure in large metropolitan areas. The detected mobility community maps present a holistic overview of public transit movement structure, enabling decision makers to make informed decisions on sustainable urban development and transit management. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","This work was jointly funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 41871308 ], National Key Research and Development Program of China (International Scientific & Technological Cooperation Program) [grant number 2019YFE0106500 ], Open fund project of National-Local Joint Engineering Laboratory on Digital Preservation and Innovative Technologies for the Culture of Traditional Villages and Towns [grant number CTCZ19K03 ].",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85106894897,Yes,China,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,Graph Embedding,Clustering,Unveil transit mobility structure using integrated graph embedding approach for sustainable cities,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

We call the resulting model stacking ensemble model. The proposed stacking ensemble model combines the best ensemble networks to improve performance prediction, yielding an R2 value of 97.89 %. The results support the effectiveness of the ensemble networks, which use Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), CatBoost and Gradient Boosting. This study also shows that the weighted meta model outperforms several machine learning models in terms of R2, MAE and RSME. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",This research was supported by Brain Pool Program funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) ( 2019H1D3A1A01102955 ) and by the Incheon National University (International Cooperative) Research Grant in 2017.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85106522009,Yes,South Korea,Energy,Smart Grid & Energy,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Stacking Ensemble,Prediction/Forecasting,Predict energy consumption in Songdo smart city using meta-regression framework,"SDG 7 (Energy), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Longitudinal,Strong

Especially, since industrial sewage is normally highly toxic, which could cause serious pollution in a city and lead to health problems of residents, it is critical to monitor and predictably maintain sewage treatment facilities in cities. This paper presents an intelligent sewage treatment system based on machine learning and Internet of Things sensors to assist to manage the sewage treatment in a fine chemical plant. The implemented system has operated for twenty months, acquired multi-dimension data such as temperatures in different treatment processes, operation parameters of devices, and real-time Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD). Since the change trend of outflow COD is highly related to operation status, this paper innovatively uses different types of temperature and water inflow data as model inputs and applies three algorithms to make prediction, which are Support Vector Regression (SVR), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network. The experimental results show that GRU model performs better (MAPE = 10.18%, RMSE = 35.67, MAE = 31.16) than LSTM and SVR.

AmI creates, by using Artificial Intelligence (AI), an intelligent ecosystem in which computers, sensors, lighting, music, personal devices, and distributed services, work together to improve the user experience through the support of natural and intuitive user interfaces. Nowadays, AmI is used in various contexts, e.g., for building smart homes and smart cities, providing healthcare, and creating an adequate atmosphere in retail and public environments. In this paper, we propose a novel AmI system for gym environments, named Gym Intelligence, able to provide adequate music atmosphere, according to the users’ physical effort during the training. The music is taken from Spotify and is classified according to some music features, as provided by Spotify itself. The system is based on a multi-agent computational intelligence model built on two main components: (i) machine learning methods that forecast appropriate values for the Spotify music features, and (ii) a multi-objective dynamic genetic algorithm that selects a specific Spotify music track, according to such values. Gym Intelligence is built by sensing the ambient with a minimal, low-cost, and non-intrusive set of sensors, and it has been designed considering the outcome of a preliminary analysis in real gyms, involving real users. We have considered well-known regression methods and we have validated them using a collected data (i) about the users’ physical effort, through the sensors, and (ii) about the users’ music preferences, through an Android app that the users have used during the training. Among the regression methods considered, the one that provided the best results is the Random Forest, which predicted Spotify music features with a mean absolute error of 0.02 and a root mean squared error of 0.05. We have implemented Gym Intelligence and deployed it in five real gyms. We have evaluated it conducting several experiments. The experiments show how, with the help of Gym Intelligence, the users’ satisfaction about the provided background music, rose from 3.05 to 4.91 (on a scale from 1 to 5, where 5 is the maximum score). © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85104365062,No,Italy,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Smart cities are composed of complex systems that usually process and analyse big data from the Cyber, Physical, and Social worlds. Traffic event detection is an important and complex task in smart transportation modelling and management. We address this problem using semi-supervised deep learning with data of different modalities, e.g., physical sensor observations and social media data. Unlike most existing studies focusing on data of single modality, the proposed method makes use of data of multiple modalities that appear to complement and reinforce each other. Meanwhile, as the amount of labelled data in big data applications is usually extremely limited, we extend the multi-modal Generative Adversarial Network model to a semi-supervised architecture to characterise traffic events. We evaluate the model with a large, real-world dataset consisting of traffic sensor observations and social media data collected from the San Francisco Bay Area over a period of four months.

As a potential solution, mobile edge computing (MEC) deploys cloud resources in the proximity of IoT devices so that their requests can be better served locally. In this work, we investigate computation offloading in a dynamic MEC system with multiple edge servers, where computational tasks with various requirements are dynamically generated by IoT devices and offloaded to MEC servers in a time-varying operating environment (e.g., channel condition changes over time). The objective of this work is to maximize the completed tasks before their respective deadlines and minimize energy consumption. To this end, we propose an end-to-end Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to select the best edge server for offloading and allocate the optimal computational resource such that the expected long-term utility is maximized.

Automatically guided vehicles depend on environmental data for executing target-oriented navigation and movements. The traffic knowledge can be used by automatically guided vehicles by measuring their intensity and delivery date in the green light. Therefore, considering sensor data's significance in this guided vehicle environment, this article presents the Internet of Things (IoT) assisted automated guided vehicle (IoT-AGV) scheme. IoT-AGV scheme discusses the implementation of an autonomous vehicle traffic control program at crossings. The traffic knowledge operator is ready to retrieve details from the sensor utilizing quick communication through a mobile network to measure optimum travel time and transmit the information collected to automated cars. In an automated guided vehicle (AGV) scheme, the automotive-into-loop model is introduced to eliminate delays. Error indicator integrates various hurdle imbalance statistics calculated from the sensor based on the road slide. A deep neural network focuses on a minimal collection of the most critical features, eliminating the fitting problem. This aids determine the error producing sensor data and alleviate them from fusion to enhance the target's accuracy.

Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) aims to manage and optimize the traffic congestion, road accidents, parking allocation using Autonomous Vehicles (AV) system, where the AVs are internally connected for message passing and critical decision making in time-sensitive applications. The data security in such applications can be offered using Blockchain (BC) technology. But, as per the existing literature, there exists no system which can call AVs automatically based on the situation, i.e., call an ambulance in case of an accident, call logistic service in case of home transfer, and call the traffic department in case of traffic jam. Motivated from the aforementioned reasons, in this article, we propose a BC-based secure and intelligent sensing and tracking architecture for AV system using beyond 5G communication network. Recently, AVs are facing issues with sensing and tracking technology as well as the data thefts. AV system contains sensitive information and transfers it through a communication channel to Connected AVs (CAVs), where the corrupted information or delay of a fraction of a second can lead to a critical situation. So, here we present possib the attacks and safety countermeasures using BC technology to protect the AV system. The proposed architecture ensures secure sensing and tracking of an object through BC by deploying AI algorithms at the edge servers. Also, the beyond 5G network enables communications with low latency and high reliability to meet the desires of the aforementioned time-sensitive applications. The proposed system is evaluated by considering the parameters as mobility and data transfer time against the traditional LTE-A and 5G communication networks. The proposed system outperforms traditional systems and can be suitable for diverse applications where latency, reliability, and security are the prime concerns. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85101585513,Yes,India,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,"Deep Learning, Blockchain",Classification,Develop blockchain-based secure intelligent sensing for autonomous vehicle tracking beyond 5G,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

In recent years, several companies have designed and tested enabling elements of this concept, including; prototypes of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, operational concepts, and market studies to understand potential business models. While UAM may be enabled by the convergence of several factors, a number of barriers such as weather could present challenges to scaling operations. This research discusses the potential weather and public acceptance challenges for operations in adverse conditions. This article presents a comprehensive seasonal and diurnal climatology analysis using historical observations across anticipated operational altitudes (surface- 5000 ft AGL) at ten metropolitan areas across the United States for the NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD). Public perceptions of weather-related societal barriers were evaluated through a five-city general population survey (n = 1,702) where respondents were asked about their views regarding flying in a small aircraft in a variety of adverse weather conditions using a six statement 5-point Likert scale. The results of the climatology analysis found weather most favorable in Los Angeles and San Francisco, with much less favorable conditions in Denver, New York City, and Washington D.C.

In this study, the authors tried to investigate the extent of urbanization of Istanbul within the past decades to unearth its impacts on the urban heat island (UHI) severity and the level of its ecological consequences in terms of decreased thermal comfort. To this end, land use/cover (LULC) and land surface temperature (LST) maps were generated using Landsat imageries based on random forest (RF) classifier (as a machine learning tool) and radiometric image processing algorithms, respectively, for four different dates from 1989 to 2019. The statistical and spectral indicators were calculated for the study area to evaluate the association between urban development and UHI. Results indicate that Istanbul has suffered a continuous land transformation from forest to urban and croplands so that the area of forest has diminished by 373.3 km2, and the artificial surfaces have increased by 260 km2. Skin temperatures over all the LULC classes show an increase during the study period with the highest values estimated over artificial surfaces. The statistical analysis of urbanization indicators (ULI, PD, UGSI, NDVI, and NDBI) and UHI indicator (UTFVI) resulted in good correlation coefficients with the best agreement found between NDBI and UTFVI which stresses the strong link between the expansion of built-up areas as a result of urbanization and the severity of UHI and its ecological impacts in Istanbul. Thus, it is a must for policy-makers and officials of the city to take accurate measures regarding the urban planning to mitigate the harsh environmental impacts of growing urbanization of Istanbul in upcoming years. © 2021, Società Italiana di Fotogrammetria e Topografia (SIFET).",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099065438,Yes,Turkey,Urban Climate,Environment & Sustainability,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Machine Learning,Classification,Evaluate environmental impacts of urbanization from increased skin temperatures in Istanbul,"SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 13 (Climate)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

Now people analyze the opinion of others before purchasing any product, hotel booking, stepping onto restaurants etc. and the respective user share their experience as a feedback towards the service. But there is no e-governance platform to obtain public opinion grievances towards covid19, government new laws, policies etc. With the growing availability and emergence of opinion rich information’s, new opportunities and challenges might arise in developing a technology for mining the huge set of public messages, opinions and alert the respective departments to take necessary actions and also nearby ambulances if its related to covid-19. To overcome this pandemic situation a natural language processing based efficient e-governance platform is demandful to detect the corona positive patients and provide transparency on the covid count and also alert the respective health ministry and nearby ambulance based on the user voice inputs. To convert the public voice messages into text, we used Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). To identify respective government department responsible for the respective user voice input, we perform pre-processing, part of speech, unigram, bigram, trigram analysis and fuzzy logic (machine learning technique). After identifying the responsible department, we perform 2 methods, (1) Automatic alert e-mail and message to the government departmental officials and nearby ambulance or covid camp if the user input is related to covis19. (2) Ticketing system for public and government officials monitoring. For experimental results, we used Java based web and mobile application to execute the proposed methodology.

Recently, there has been some discussion on the adoption of such technologies and their impact on hotels’ operational costs as well as the quality of service to customers. Considering the importance of these new technologies, this paper investigates the trend related to the adoption of AI and robotics in the hotel industry. For this purpose, we interviewed senior hotel asset managers using an in-depth case study method. The context is Dubai-based hotels as Dubai is already established as one of the premier smart cities of the world (Khan et al., 2017). The TOE framework was used, and three domains were investigated: technology, organization, and environment to expose the underlying factors effecting AI adoption. The findings expose the factors that influence the adoption of AI and robotics in hotels.

Land degradation has a negative impact on the livelihood and food security worldwide. The annual cost of land degradation caused by land use land cover change is estimated at 231 billion US dollars. It should be noticed that recent droughts caused by global climate change and, on the other hand, population growth have increased the rate of urbanization in Iran. In this study, to monitor the recent urbanization, several advanced and state-of-the-art classification algorithms, including small and large neural networks, support vector machine, and the genetic algorithm multi-layer perceptron (GAMLP) model, are developed in R and MATLAB programming languages for land use land cover modeling in the years 1990 and 2018 of the Shiraz City. For the year 1990, the SVM algorithm has the best performance in terms of overall accuracy and kappa indices with the values of 93.55 and 89.22, respectively. The SVM classifier has better performance for the year 2018 as well, with values of 98.37 and 95.76 for the overall accuracy and kappa indices.

Searching for available parking spots can be a time-consuming task that simultaneously increases traffic congestion and greenhouse gas pollution by a significant 40%. A solution that would increase drivers' ability to locate an empty parking spot would represent an important step towards more sustainable parking as it would have a direct impact on reducing greenhouse gas pollution in urban areas. This paper proposes how data science can help by evaluating the prediction performance of four machine learning models. Analysed machine learning models are based on different machine learning methods (i.e., CatBoost and Random Forest) and use different real-world data sets (i.e., parking sensor data only or contextually enriched parking sensor data). The dummy (baseline) model is considered as well, but with a R2 score of 61.29% is outperformed by more advanced data science approaches. Prediction performance in the case of using parking sensor data only gives R2 score of 84.31% and 88.16% for Random Forest and CatBoost, respectively. The best prediction performance is achieved using CatBoost and contextually enriched data, resulting in the high-performing machine learning model with the R2 value of 88.83%, thus outperforming the Random Forest model by 1.7%. In fact, for both machine learning methods, the contextually enriched data approach gives better results for predicting parking spot availability. This suggests that parking data should be enriched with contextual data when designing and building sustainable parking solutions for smart cities of the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","The authors would like to thank company Split Parking d. o.o. for providing the real-world parking data for the city of Split.

Due to the constrained computation and storage resources, IoT devices have resorted to the powerful cloud computing to process their data. However, centralized and remote cloud computing may introduce unacceptable communication delay since its physical location is far away from IoT devices. Edge cloud has been introduced to overcome this issue by moving the cloud in closer proximity to IoT devices. The orchestration and cooperation between the cloud and the edge provides a crucial computing architecture for IoT applications. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful tool to enable the intelligent orchestration in this architecture. This article first introduces such a kind of computing architecture from the perspective of IoT applications. It then investigates the state-of-the-art proposals on AI-powered cloud-edge orchestration for the IoT.

However, limited by capability of mobile device, the reliability and latency requirements of AR applications is difficult to meet by local processing. To solve this problem, we study a binary offloading scheme for AR edge computing. Based on the proposed model, the parts of AR computing can offload to edge network servers, which is extend the computing capability of mobile AR devices. Moreover, a deep reinforcement learning offloading model is considered to acquire B5G network resource allocation and optimally AR offloading decisions. First, this offloading model does not need to solve combinatorial optimization, which is greatly reduced the computational complexity. Then the wireless channel gains and binary offloading states is modeled as a Markov decision process, and solved by deep reinforcement learning.

Since the 1900s, urbanization has become an underlying cause of LUCC, and more than 55% of the world’s population resides in cities. The speedy growth, development and expansion of urban centers, rapid inhabitant’s growth, land insufficiency, the necessity for more manufacture, advancement of technologies remain among the several drivers of LUCC around the globe at present. In this study, the urban expansion or sprawl, together with spatial dynamics of Hyderabad, Pakistan over the last four decades were investigated and reviewed, based on remotely sensed Landsat images from 1979 to 2020. In particular, radiometric and atmospheric corrections were applied to these raw images, then the Gaussian-based Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel was used for training, within the 10-fold support vector machine (SVM) supervised classification framework. After spatial LUCC maps were retrieved, different metrics like Producer’s Accuracy (PA), User’s Accuracy (UA) and KAPPA coefficient (KC) were adopted for spatial accuracy assessment to ensure the reliability of the proposed satellite-based retrieval mechanism. Landsat-derived results showed that there was an increase in the amount of built-up area and a decrease in vegetation and agricultural lands. Built-up area in 1979 only covered 30.69% of the total area, while it has increased and reached 65.04% after four decades. In contrast, continuous reduction of agricultural land, vegetation, waterbody, and barren land was observed. Overall, throughout the four-decade period, the portions of agricultural land, vegetation, waterbody, and barren land have decreased by 13.74%, 46.41%, 49.64% and 85.27%, respectively. These remotely observed changes highlight and symbolize the spatial characteristics of “rural to urban transition” and socioeconomic development within a modernized city, Hyderabad, which open new windows for detecting potential land-use changes and laying down feasible future urban development and planning strategies. © 2021 by the authors.

Effective on-street parking availability prediction can improve parking efficiency and, at times, alleviate city congestion. Conventional methods of parking availability prediction often do not consider the spatial–temporal features of parking duration distributions. To this end, we propose a parking space prediction scheme called the hybrid spatial–temporal graph convolution networks (HST-GCNs). We use graph convolutional networks and gated linear units (GLUs) with a 1D convolutional neural network to obtain the spatial features and the temporal features, respectively. Then, we construct a spatial–temporal convolutional block to obtain the instantaneous spatial–temporal correlations. Based on the similarity of the parking duration distributions, we propose an attention mechanism called dist Att to measure the similarity of parking duration distributions. Through the dist Att mechanism, we add the long-term spatial– temporal correlations to our spatial–temporal convolutional block, and thus, we can capture complex hybrid spatial–temporal correlations to achieve a higher accuracy of parking availability prediction. Based on real-world datasets, we compare the proposed scheme with the benchmark models. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme has the best performance in predicting the parking occupancy rate. © 2020 by the authors.

The standardization of Chinese place name and address occupies an important position in the construction of a smart city. Traditional address specification technology often adopts methods based on text similarity or rule bases, which cannot handle complex, missing, and redundant address information well. This paper transforms the task of address standardization into calculating the similarity of address pairs, and proposes a contrast learning address matching model based on the attention-Bi-LSTM-CNN network (ABLC). First of all, ABLC use the Trie syntax tree algorithm to extract Chinese address elements. Next, based on the basic idea of contrast learning, a hybrid neural network is applied to learn the semantic information in the address. Finally, Manhattan distance is calculated as the similarity of the two addresses.

AI, if implemented ethically for sustainability, can enhance biodiversity, conserve water and energy resources, provide land-related services, power smart cities, and help mitigate climate change. However, there are significant issues in using AI to transition to sustainable food systems. AI’s own carbon footprint could cancel out any sustainability benefits that it creates. Additionally, the technology could further entrench inequalities between and within countries, and bias against minorities or less powerful groups. This paper draws on findings from a study of the Victorian Farmers’ Markets Association (VFMA) that investigated the complexity of designing AI tools to enhance sustainability and resilience for the benefit of the organisation and its members. Codesign workshops, both synchronous and asynchronous, semi-structured interviews, and design innovation methods led the VFMA to experiment with an AI tool to link sustainable soil practices, nutrient rich produce, and human health. The analysis shows that the codesign process and an agile approach created a co-learning environment where sustainability and ethical questions could be considered iteratively within transdisciplinary engagement. The bottom-up approach developed through this study supports organisations who want to engage with AI while reinforcing fairness, transparency, and sustainability. © 2021 by the author.

Having collected large quantities of text data from public consultation, the challenge is often how to interpret the dataset without resorting to lengthy time-consuming manual analysis. One approach gaining ground is the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies. Based on machine learning technology applied to analysis of human natural languages, NLP provides the opportunity to automate data analysis for large volumes of texts at a scale that would be virtually impossible to analyse manually. Using NLP toolkits, this paper presents a novel approach for identifying and visualising shared ideas from large format public consultation. The approach analyses grammatical structures of public texts to discover shared ideas from sentences comprising subject + verb + object and verb + object that express public options. In particular, the shared ideas are identified by extracting noun, verb, adjective phrases and clauses from subjects and objects, which are then categorised by urban infrastructure categories and terms. The results are visualised in a hierarchy chart and a word tree using cascade and tree views. The approach is illustrated using data collected from a public consultation exercise called “Share an Idea” undertaken in Christchurch, New Zealand, after the 2011 earthquake. The approach has the potential to upscale public participation to identify shared design values and associated qualities for a wide range of public initiatives including urban planning. © 2021 by the authors.

The FAO estimates that wildfires result in at least USD 1 billion in agriculture-related losses due to the destruction of livestock pasture, destruction of agricultural buildings, premature death of farm animals, and general disruption of agricultural activities. Even though artificial neural networks (ANNs), genetic algorithms (GAs), probabilistic neural networks (PNNs), and adaptive neurofuzzy inference systems (AN-FISs), among others, have proven useful in fire prevention, their application is limited in real farm environments. Most farms rely on traditional/non-technology-based methods of fire prevention. The case for AI in agricultural fire prevention is grounded on the accuracy and reliability of computer simulations in smoke movement analysis, risk assessment, and postfire analysis. In addition, such technologies can be coupled with next-generation fire-retardant materials such as intumescent coatings with a polymer binder, blowing agent, carbon donor, and acid donor. Future prospects for AI in agriculture transcend basic fire safety to encompass Society 5.0, energy systems in smart cities, UAV monitoring, Agriculture 4.0, and decentralized energy. However, critical challenges must be overcome, including the health and safety aspects, cost, and reliability.

Existing gauge station data and remote sensing data still has limited spatial and temporal resolution and coverage. Therefore, to expand flood depth data source taking use of online image resources in an efficient manner, an automated, low-cost, and real-time working frame called FloodMask was developed to obtain flood depth from online images containing flooded traffic signs. The method was built on the deep learning framework of Mask R-CNN (regional convolutional neural network), trained by collected and manually annotated traffic sign images. Following further the proposed image processing frame, flood depth data were retrieved more efficiently than manual estimations. As the main results, the flood depth estimates from images (without any mirror reflection and other inference problems) have an average error of 0.11 m, when compared to human visual inspection measurements. This developed method can be further coupled with street CCTV cameras, social media photos, and on-board vehicle cameras to facilitate the development of a smart city with a prompt and efficient flood monitoring system.

The semantic segmentation of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds is a fundamental approach for urban scene analysis. Over the last years, several methods have been developed to segment urban furniture with point clouds. However, the traditional processing of large amounts of spatial data has become increasingly costly, both time-wise and financially. Recently, deep learning (DL) techniques have been increasingly used for 3D segmentation tasks. Yet, most of these deep neural networks (DNNs) were conducted on benchmarks. It is, therefore, arguable whether DL approaches can achieve the state-of-the-art performance of 3D point clouds segmentation in real-life scenarios. In this research, we apply an adapted DNN (ARandLA-Net) to directly process large-scale point clouds. In particular, we develop a new paradigm for training and validation, which presents a typical urban scene in central Europe (Munzingen, Freiburg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany). Our dataset consists of nearly 390 million dense points acquired by Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS), which has a rather larger quantity of sample points in comparison to existing datasets and includes meaningful object categories that are particular to applications for smart cities and urban planning. We further assess the DNN on our dataset and investigate a number of key challenges from varying aspects, such as data preparation strategies, the advantage of color information and the unbalanced class distribution in the real world. The final segmentation model achieved a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) score of 54.4% and an overall accuracy score of 83.9%. Our experiments indicated that different data preparation strategies influenced the model performance. Additional RGB information yielded an approximately 4% higher mIoU score. Our results also demonstrate that the use of weighted cross-entropy with inverse square root frequency loss led to better segmentation performance than when other losses were considered. © 2021 by the authors.

This study proposes an AI and human co-operative evaluation (AIHCE) framework that facilitates communication design between designers and stakeholders based on human emotions and values and is an evaluation method for street space. AIHCE is an evaluation method based on image recognition technology that performs deep learning of the facial expressions of both people and the city; namely, it consists of a facial expression recognition model (FERM) and a street image evaluation model (SIEM). The former evaluates the street space based on the emotions and values of the pedestrian’s facial expression, and the latter evaluates the target street space from the prepared street space image. AIHCE is an integrated framework for these two models, enabling continuous and objective evaluation of space with simultaneous subjective emotional evaluation, showing the possibility of reflecting it in the design. It is expected to contribute to fostering people’s awareness that streets are public goods reflecting the basic functions of public spaces and the values and regional characteristics of residents, contributing to the improvement of the sustainability of the entire city. © 2021 by the authors.

Urban heat island is are of the most well-known phenomena. In the present study, surface urban heat islands (SUHI) were studied for seven megacities of the South Asian countries from 2000–2019. The urban thermal environment and relationship between land surface temperature (LST), land use landcover (LULC) and vegetation were examined. The connection was explored with remote-sensing indices such as urban thermal field variance (UTFVI), surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) and normal difference vegetation index (NDVI). LULC maps are classified using a CART machine learning classifier, and an accuracy table was generated. The LULC change matrix shows that the vegetated areas of all the cities decreased with an increase in the urban areas during the 20 years. The average LST in the rural areas is increasing compared to the urban core, and the difference is in the range of 1–2 (C). The SUHII linear trend is increasing in Delhi, Karachi, Kathmandu, and Thimphu, while decreasing in Colombo, Dhaka, and Kabul from 2000–2019.

However, the vast majority of the approaches rely on very high-resolution satellite imagery (<2.5 m) whose costs are not yet affordable for maintaining up-to-date maps. Working with the limited spatial resolution provided by high-resolution satellite imagery such as Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 (10 m) makes it hard to detect buildings and roads, since these labels may coexist within the same pixel. This paper focuses on this problem and presents a novel methodology capable of detecting building and roads with sub-pixel width by increasing the resolution of the output masks. This methodology consists of fusing Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data (at 10 m) together with OpenStreetMap to train deep learning models for building and road detection at 2.5 m. This becomes possible thanks to the usage of OpenStreetMap vector data, which can be rasterized to any desired resolution. Accordingly, a few simple yet effective modifications of the U-Net architecture are proposed to not only semantically segment the input image, but also to learn how to enhance the resolution of the output masks. As a result, generated mappings quadruplicate the input spatial resolution, closing the gap between satellite and aerial imagery for building and road detection. To properly evaluate the generalization capabilities of the proposed methodology, a data-set composed of 44 cities across the Spanish territory have been considered and divided into training and testing cities. Both quantitative and qualitative results show that high-resolution satellite imagery can be used for sub-pixel width building and road detection following the proper methodology. © 2021 by the authors.

Most attempts at using AI to improve efficiencies in cities have nevertheless ei-ther struggled or failed to accomplish the smart city transformation. This is mainly due to short-sighted, technologically determined and reductionist AI approaches being applied to complex urbanization problems. Besides this, as smart cities are underpinned by our ability to engage with our environments, analyze them, and make efficient, sustainable and equitable decisions, the need for a green AI approach is intensified. This perspective paper, reflecting authors’ opinions and interpretations, concentrates on the “green AI” concept as an enabler of the smart city trans-formation, as it offers the opportunity to move away from purely technocentric efficiency solutions towards efficient, sustainable and equitable solutions capable of realizing the desired urban fu-tures. The aim of this perspective paper is two-fold: first, to highlight the fundamental shortfalls in mainstream AI system conceptualization and practice, and second, to advocate the need for a consolidated AI approach—i.e., green AI—to further support smart city transformation. The methodological approach includes a thorough appraisal of the current AI and smart city litera-tures, practices, developments, trends and applications. The paper informs authorities and plan-ners on the importance of the adoption and deployment of AI systems that address efficiency, sustainability and equity issues in cities. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper presents a mobile mapping system mounted on an electric tricycle and a procedure for creating on-street parking statistics, which allow government agencies and policy makers to verify and adjust parking policies in different city districts. Our method combines georeferenced red-green-blue-depth (RGB-D) imagery from two low-cost 3D cameras with state-of-the-art 3D object detection algorithms for extracting and mapping parked vehicles. Our investigations demonstrate the suitability of the latest generation of low-cost 3D cameras for real-world outdoor applications with respect to supported ranges, depth measurement accuracy, and robustness under varying lighting conditions. In an evaluation of suitable algorithms for detecting vehicles in the noisy and often incomplete 3D point clouds from RGB-D cameras, the 3D object detection network PointRCNN, which extends region-based convolutional neural networks (R-CNNs) to 3D point clouds, clearly outperformed all other candidates. The results of a mapping mission with 313 parking spaces show that our method is capable of reliably detecting parked cars with a precision of 100% and a recall of 97%. It can be applied to unslotted and slotted parking and different parking types including parallel, perpendicular, and angle parking. © 2021 by the authors.

However, as the number and diversity of ML techniques increase, questions arise about their performance and applicability, and on the most suitable ML method depending on the specific application. Trying to answer these questions, this manuscript presents a systematic review of the state-of-the-art studies implementing ML techniques in the context of power systems, with a specific focus on the analysis of power flows, power quality, photovoltaic systems, intelligent transportation, and load forecasting. The survey investigates, for each of the selected topics, the most recent and promising ML techniques proposed by the literature, by highlighting their main characteristics and relevant results. The review revealed that, when compared to traditional approaches, ML algorithms can handle massive quantities of data with high dimensionality, by allowing the identification of hidden characteristics of (even) complex systems. In particular, even though very different techniques can be used for each application, hybrid models generally show better performances when compared to single ML-based models. © 2021 by the authors.

However, tree detection in cities is challenging, given the irregular shape, size, occlusion, and complexity of urban areas. With the advance of environmental technologies, deep learning segmentation mapping methods can map urban forests accurately. We applied a region-based CNN object instance segmentation algorithm for the semantic segmentation of tree canopies in urban environments based on aerial RGB imagery. To the best of our knowledge, no study investigated the performance of deep learning-based methods for segmentation tasks inside the Cerrado biome, specifically for urban tree segmentation. Five state-of-the-art architectures were evaluated, namely: Fully Convolutional Network; U-Net; SegNet; Dynamic Dilated Convolution Network and DeepLabV3+. The experimental analysis showed the effectiveness of these methods reporting results such as pixel accuracy of 96,35%, an average accuracy of 91.25%, F1-score of 91.40%, Kappa of 82.80% and IoU of 73.89%. We also determined the inference time needed per area, and the deep learning methods investigated after the training proved to be suitable to solve this task, providing fast and effective solutions with inference time varying from 0.042 to 0.153 minutes per hectare. We conclude that the semantic segmentation of trees inside urban environments is highly achievable with deep neural networks. This information could be of high importance to decision-making and may contribute to the management of urban systems.

An increasing urban population fuels urban expansion and reduces nearby agricultural lands and natural environments such as forests, swamps, other water-pervious areas. Unsustainable development creates a disproportion between the growth of urban areas and the growth in urban population. The UN SDG indicator 11.3.1 specifically addresses the issue of the measurement of land-use efficiency. While the metric and methodology to estimate the indicator are straightforward, it faces problems of data unavaila-bility and inconsistency. Vietnam has a record of tremendous economic growth that has translated into more urban settlements of size. Consequently, rural population movement into urban areas has led to many urban sustainable planning and development challenges. In the absence of previous work on estimating land-use efficiency in Vietnamese cities, this study makes the first attempt to examine land-use efficiency in Ha Long, one of the country’s fast-growing cities in recent decades. We mapped land use from high-resolution Landsat imagery (30 m) spanning multi-decadal obser-vations from 1986 to 2020. An advanced machine learning approach, the Support Vector Machine algorithm, was applied to estimate the built-up area, which, by integration with census data, is es-sential for calculating SDG indicator 11.3.1. This study shows that the land-use efficiency metric was positive but small at the beginning of the considered period but increased in 2000–2020. These results suggest that before 2000, the urban land consumption rate in Ha Long was lower than the population growth rate, implying denser urban land use. The situation changed to the opposite when the urban land consumption rate exceeded the population growth rate in the past two dec-ades. The study’s approach is applicable to regional and district levels to provide comparative analyses between cities or parts of a region or districts of the city. These analyses are valuable tools for assessing the impact of local urban and municipal planning policies on urban development. © 2021 by the authors.

To achieve this goal, garbage classification is one of the most important steps during the recycling process. Prevailing deep learning techniques empower high-performance visual recognition models and can benefit the automation of garbage classification task. Nevertheless, there exist three challenges when directly leveraging deep recognition models for this task, referring to lack of sufficient data, high cost of category increment, and noisy data quality. In this article, we present a novel incremental learning framework, GarbageNet, to address the aforementioned challenges. First, weakly-supervised transfer learning guarantees the capacity of feature extractor. Second, for new categories of garbages, GarbageNet embeds them as anchors for reference and classifies the test samples by finding their nearest neighbors in the latent space. Third, an attentive mixup of training data is utilized for suppressing the negative effect of mislabeled data. We evaluate our method on real-world datasets, and the empirical results demonstrate that GarbageNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance with regard to accuracy, robustness, and extendability. The proposed method won the first place in the HUAWEI Cloud Garbage Classification Challenge in 2019. Impact Statement-This article contributes to a vision-based garbage recognition system for the recyclability of domestic waste. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first article that explores a realistic vision-based solution for the garbage recognition with a real-world dataset and a comprehensive benchmark on current state-of-the-art visual recognition models. The proposed method addresses several challenges and achieves state-of-the-art performance. We believe that this interdisciplinary research contributes to the AI for the environment, which helps promote environmental ethics, bring rotation economy, and relieve the pressure of consumption doctrine in smart city. © 2021 IEEE.","Manuscript received January 18, 2021; revised April 1, 2021; accepted May 12, 2021.

However, with the expanding scale of networking, the failure of some nodes in the network severely affects the communication capacity of IoT applications. Therefore, researchers pay attention to improving communication capacity caused by network failures for applications that require high quality of services (QoS). Furthermore, the robustness of network topology is an important metric to measure the network communication capacity and the ability to resist the cyber-attacks induced by some failed nodes. While some algorithms have been proposed to enhance the robustness of IoT topologies, they are characterized by large computation overhead, and lacking a lightweight topology optimization model. To address this problem, we first propose a novel robustness optimization using evolution learning (ROEL) with a neural network. ROEL dynamically optimizes the IoT topology and intelligently prospects the robust degree in the process of evolutionary optimization. The experimental results demonstrate that ROEL can represent the evolutionary process of IoT topologies, and the prediction accuracy of network robustness is satisfactory with a small error ratio. Our algorithm has a better tolerance capacity in terms of resistance to random attacks and malicious attacks compared with other algorithms. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.","This work is supported by the Joint Funds of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. U2001204), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61672131), the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2019YFB1703601), and the Tianjin Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars.

The increase in LST massively impacted the urban biodiversity, ecosystem and population health. This study aims to estimate the changes in LULC classes and identify their impacts on LST in Dhaka city, Bangladesh using Landsat satellite images from 2000 to 2020. Based on the past estimated change maps of LULC and LST, the study finally predicted the future LULC and LST scenario for the year 2030. The support vector machine algorithm was applied to perform the LULC classification. Artificial neural network and cellular automata algorithms were used to predict the LST and LULC changes for 2030. Results suggested a significant reduction in vegetation cover (5%) and an increase in built-up area (14%) from 2000 to 2020. Due to this massive increase in built-up areas, the LST increment took place by 7.24 °C in the last two decades. The maximum temperature was recorded in built-up areas (34 °C), and water bodies (19 °C) exhibited minimum temperature. A strong positive correlation was found between LST and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), where negative relation estimated between LST and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). The predicted results for 2030 also exhibit significant loss of urban green cover areas by 13% and rises in built-up areas by 21%. The maximum LST will likely be increased by 9.29 °C in the predicted year. For ensuring sustainable urban development and minimizing the urban heat island effects, this study will play a significant role by providing effective guidelines for urban planners, policymakers and respective authorities of Dhaka city. © 2021","The authors like to express their thanks for supporting this research with datasets to Rajshahi Development Authority, Rajshahi City Corporation, and the United States Geological Survey.

This paper aims to propose a pedestrian analytics approach named vectors of uncountable and countable objects for clustering and analysis (VUCCA) for processing 530,000 TSV photographs of Hong Kong Island. First, VUCCA transductively adopts two pre-trained deep models to TSV photographs for extracting pedestrians and surrounding pixels into generalizable semantic vectors of features, including uncountable objects such as vegetation, sky, paved pedestrian path, and guardrail and countable objects such as cars, trucks, pedestrians, city animals, and traffic lights. Then, the extracted pedestrians are semantically clustered using the vectors, e.g., for understanding where they usually stand. Third, pedestrians are semantically indexed using relations and activities (e.g., walking behind a guardrail, road-crossing, carrying a backpack, or walking a pet) for queries of unstructured photographic instances or natural language clauses. The experiment results showed that the pedestrians detected in the TSV photographs were successfully clustered into meaningful groups and indexed by the semantic vectors. The presented VUCCA can enrich eye-level urban features into computational semantic vectors for pedestrians to enable smart city research in urban geography, urban planning, real estate, transportation, conservation, and other disciplines. © 2021 by the authors.

The existing manual methods of measuring building façade color are limited by time and labor costs and hardly carried out on a city scale. These methods also make it challenging to identify the role of the building function in controlling and guiding urban color planning. This paper explores a city-scale approach to façade color measurement with building functional classification using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and street view images. Firstly, we used semantic segmentation to extract building façades and conducted the color calibration of the photos for pre-processing the collected street view images. Then, we proposed a color chart-based façade color measurement method and a multi-label deep learning-based building classification method. Next, the field survey data were used as the ground truth to verify the accuracy of the façade color measurement and building function classification. Finally, we applied our approach to generate façade color distribution maps with the building classification for three metropolises in China, and the results proved the transferability and effectiveness of the scheme. The proposed approach can provide city managers with an overall perception of urban façade color and building function across city-scale areas in a cost-efficient way, contributing to data-driven decision making for urban analytics and planning. © 2021 by the authors.

An intelligent medical system for brain tumor segmentation is required to construct smart hospitals. To achieve intelligent brain tumor segmentation, morphological variety and serious category imbalance must be managed effectively. Conventional deep neural networks have difficulty in predicting high-accuracy segmentation images due to these issues. To solve these problems, we propose using multimodal brain tumor images combined with the UNET and LSTM models to construct a new network structure with a mixed loss function to solve sample imbalance and describe an intelligent segmentation process to identify brain tumors. To verify the practicability of this algorithm, we used the open source Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge dataset to train and verify the proposed network. We obtained DSCs of 0.91, 0.82, and 0.80; sensitivities of 0.93, 0.85, and 0.82; and specificities of 0.99, 0.99, and 0.98 in three tumor regions, including the whole tumor (WT), tumor core (TC), and enhanced tumor (ET). We also compared the results of the proposed network with those of other brain tumor segmentation methods, and the results showed that the proposed algorithm could segment different tumor lesions more accurately, highlighting its potential application value in the clinical diagnosis of brain tumors. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.","This work is supported by National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2018YFC0407904), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51667017), and Key Research Projects of Tibet Autonomous Region for Innovation and Entrepreneur (Grant No. Z2016D01G01/01).

Vehicle localization is critical for ITS since the safety driving and location-aware serves highly depend on the accurate location information. In this article, we construct a vehicle localization system architecture composed of multiple Internet of Things (IoT) with arbitrary array configuration and a large amount of vehicles in smart cities. In order to deal with the coexisting of circular and non-circular signals transmitted by vehicles, we proposed several vehicle number estimation methods for non-circular signals. Based on the machine learning technique, we extend the vehicle number estimation method into mixed signals in more complex scenario of smart cities. Then the DOA estimation method for non-circular signals based on IoT is proposed, and then the performance of this method is analyzed as well. Simulation outcomes verify the excellent performance of the proposed vehicle number estimation methods and the DOA estimation method in smart cities, and the vehicle positions can be achieved with high estimation accuracy. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114279400,Yes,Italy,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,LSTM,Prediction/Forecasting,Predict short-term traffic flows using neural network architectures for smart cities,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

One of the important components of an elliptic-curve-based cryptosystem is the elliptic-curve point multiplication which has been shown to be vulnerable to various types of side-channel attacks. Recently, substantial progress has been made in applying deep learning to side-channel attacks. Conceptually, the idea is to monitor a core while it is running encryption for information leakage of a certain kind, for example, power consumption. The knowledge of the underlying encryption algorithm can be used to train a model to recognise the key used for encryption. The model is then applied to traces gathered from the crypto core in order to recover the encryption key. In this article, we propose an RNS GLV elliptic curve cryptography core which is immune to machine learning and deep learning based side-channel attacks. The experimental analysis confirms the proposed crypto core does not leak any information about the private key and therefore it is suitable for hardware implementations. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114279145,Yes,South Korea,Urban Climate,Environment & Sustainability,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Deep Learning,Prediction/Forecasting,Predict surface urban heat island intensity using convolutional neural networks,"SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 13 (Climate)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

The advancements in deep learning have greatly enhanced visual understanding, but the domain of aerial vision remains largely unexplored. Aerial images pose many unique challenges for performing proper scene parsing such as high-resolution data, small-scaled objects, a large number of objects in the camera view, dense clustering of objects, background clutter, and so on, which greatly hinder the performance of the existing deep learning methods. In this work, we propose ISDNet (Instance Segmentation and Detection Network), a novel network to perform instance segmentation and object detection on visual data captured by UAVs. This work enables aerial image analytics for various needs in a smart city. In particular, we use dilated convolutions to generate improved spatial context, leading to better discrimination between foreground and background features. The proposed network efficiently reuses the segment-mask features by propagating them from early stages using residual connections. Furthermore, ISDNet makes use of effective anchors to accommodate varying object scales and sizes. The proposed method obtains state-of-the-art results in the aerial context. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.","This work is supported by BITS Additional Competitive Research Grant funding under Project Grant File no.

Smart parking is one of the building blocks of intelligent mobility, innovative mobility that aims to be flexible, integrated, and sustainable and consequently integrated into a Smart City. By using the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors located in the parking areas or the underground car parks in combination with a mobile application, which indicates to citizens the free places in the different areas of the city and guides them toward the chosen parking, it is possible to reduce air pollution and fluidifying noise traffic. In this article, we present and discuss an innovative Deep Learning-based ensemble technique in forecasting the parking space occupancy to reduce the search time for parking and to optimize the flow of cars in particularly congested areas, with an overall positive impact on traffic in urban centres. A genetic algorithm has also been used to optimize predictors parameters. The main goal is to design an intelligent IoT-based service that can predict, in the next few hours, the parking spaces occupancy of a street. The proposed approach has been assessed on a real IoT dataset composed by over than 15M of collected sensor records. Obtained results demonstrate that our method outperforms both single predictors and the widely used strategy of the mean providing inherently robust predictions. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.","This work was also supported by CeSMA, Centro Servizi Metrologici e Tecnologici Avanzati, University of Naples Federico II (http://www.cesma.unina.it).

The goal of social media representation learning is to learn dense, low-dimensional, and continuous representations for multimodal data within social networks, facilitating many real-world applications. Since social media images are usually accompanied by rich metadata (e.g., textual descriptions, tags, groups, and submitted users), simply modeling the image is not effective to learn the comprehensive information from social media images. In this work, we treat the image and its textual description as multimodal content, and transform other metainformation into the links between contents (such as two images marked by the same tag or submitted by the same user). Based on the multimodal content and social links, we propose a Deep Attentive Multimodal Graph Embedding model named DAMGE for more effective social image representation learning.

A pre-processing signal processing method is applied to clean clutter signals from UWB radar. Instead of the conventional counting methods, which manually extract features and learned from effective data patterns, we investigated deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that automatically learn from the data to count the number of people in an indoor space. The CNN model could accurately predict up to 97% accuracy for up to 10 people random walking in an area of 5 × 5 m.

Rainstorms and waterlogging have become one of the most common natural disasters in the coastal areas of China. As a result, the concept of an ecological sponge city was incorporated into the construction of cities in the future. Taking Shenzhen–Shantou special cooperation zone (SSCZ), we constructed a storm flooding model based on the SCS flow generation model and GIS to explore the spatial distribution characteristics of the flooding risk in a rainstorm of 100‐year lasting 1 h. Combined with population and economic indicators, a radial basis function (RBF) network was utilized to evaluate the environmental risk, the vulnerability of disaster‐bearing bodies, and the rain–flood resilience of sponge cities. The self‐organizing feature mapping (SOFM) model was used for cluster analysis. Spatial differences were found in the construction suitability of the study area. A suitable construction area (73.59% of the entire area) was located downtown. The construction of the artificial spongy body in the highest vulnerable area (3.25%) needs to be strengthened. The control construction area (3.3%) is located along the banks of the river, with relatively high risk and low resilience of flood control engineering. Ecological construction (19.85%) serves as the sponge body of ecological buffer. The factors of waterlogging, ecology, population, and economy could be integrated com-prehensively by applying neural network methods for urban planning and construction. © 2021 by the authors.

Several issues have hindered progress in HAR research, particularly due to the emergence of fog and edge computing, which brings many new opportunities (a low latency, dynamic and real-time decision making, etc.) but comes with its challenges. This paper focuses on addressing two important research gaps in HAR research: (i) improving the HAR prediction accuracy and (ii) managing the frequent changes in the environment and data related to user activities. To address this, we propose an HAR method based on Soft-Voting and Self-Learning (SVSL). SVSL uses two strategies. First, to enhance accuracy, it combines the capabilities of Deep Learning (DL), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and AdaBoost classifiers using soft-voting. Second, to classify the most challenging data instances, the SVSL method is equipped with a self-training mechanism that generates training data and retrains itself. We investigate the performance of our proposed SVSL method using two publicly available datasets on six human activities related to lying, sitting, and walking positions. The first dataset consists of 562 features and the second dataset consists of five features. The data are collected using the accelerometer and gyroscope smartphone sensors. The results show that the proposed method provides 6.26%, 1.75%, 1.51%, and 4.40% better prediction accuracy (average over the two datasets) compared to GLM, DL, RF, and AdaBoost, respectively. We also analyze and compare the class-wise performance of the SVSL methods with that of DL, GLM, RF, and AdaBoost. © 2021 by the author.

Karachi, Pakistan’s economic hub, is also showing signs of swift urbanization. Owing to the construction of infrastructure projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and associated urbanization, Karachi’s climate has been significantly affected. The associated replacement of natural surfaces by anthropogenic materials results in urban overheating and increased local temperatures leading to serious health issues and higher air pollution. Thus, these temperature changes and urban overheating effects must be addressed to minimize their impact on the city’s population. For analyzing the urban overheating of Karachi city, LST (land surface temperature) is assessed in the current study, where data of the past 20 years (2000–2020) is used. For this purpose, remote sensing data from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM) and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors were utilized. The long short-term memory (LSTM) model was utilized where the road density (RD), elevation, and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) are used as input parameters. Upon comparing estimated and measured LST, the values of mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are 0.27 K, 0.237, and 0.15% for January, and 0.29 K, 0.261, and 0.13% for May, respectively. The low MAE, MSE, and MAPE values show a higher correlation between the predicted and observed LST values. Moreover, results show that more than 90% of the pixel data falls in the least possible error range of −1 K to +1 K. The MAE, MSE and MAPE values for Support Vector Regression (SVR) are 0.52 K, 0.453 and 0.18% and 0.76 K, 0.873, and 0.26%. The current model outperforms previous studies, shows a higher accuracy, and depicts greater reliability to predict the actual scenario. In the future, based on the accurate LST results from this model, city planners can propose mitigation strategies to reduce the harmful effects of urban overheating and associated Urban Heat Island effects (UHI). © 2021 by the authors.

Existing fixed traffic light control systems split the traffic light signal into fixed duration and run in an inefficient way, therefore, it suffers from many weaknesses such as long waiting time, waste of fuel and increase in carbon emission. To tackle these issues and increase efficiency of the traffic light control system, in this work, a Dynamic and Intelligent Traffic Light Control System (DITLCS) is proposed which takes real-time traffic information as the input and dynamically adjusts the traffic light duration. Further, the proposed DITLCS runs in three modes namely Fair Mode (FM), Priority Mode (PM) and Emergency Mode (EM) where all the vehicles are considered with equal priority, vehicles of different categories are given different level of priority and emergency vehicles are given at most priority respectively. Furthermore, a deep reinforcement learning model is also proposed to switch the traffic lights in different phases (Red, Green and Yellow), and fuzzy inference system selects one mode among three modes i.e., FM, PM and EM according to the traffic information. We have evaluated DITLCS via realistic simulation on Gwalior city map of India using an open-source simulator i.e., Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO). The simulation results prove the efficiency of DITLCS in comparison to other state of the art algorithms on various performance parameters. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Manuscript received July 9, 2019; revised December 2, 2019 and January 28, 2020; accepted March 23, 2020.

This study evaluated various advertising scenarios’ effectiveness and explained why there is a performance gap usually between five to ten times worse compared to the past. This study discusses the problems encountered when implementing the advertising system and how to improve them. This study also examines advertising interaction methods based on 5G features, business cooperation and profit splitting with telecom operators, and more diversified data application orientations and possibilities such as market surveys, urban traffic, security issues, and epidemic prevention.

While many of these unidentified sites likely contain significant levels of highly toxic and biologically persistent contamination, locating them remains a significant challenge. We propose a new method to identify manufactured gas production, storage, and distribution infrastructure in bulk by applying feature extraction and machine learning techniques to digitized historic Sanborn fire insurance maps.

However, because scholars have so far focused mainly on the magnitude of the UHI effect, there is still a lack of research on the quantitative evaluation of the relationship between urban expansion and the degree of the UHI effect from the urban agglomeration perspective. This paper analyzed the spatiotemporal characteristics and the interactive mechanism of the surface urban heat island footprint (SUHI FP) in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration (YRDUA). The summer footprints (FPs) of 27 cities were extracted using a logistics model, and the temporal trend was estimated by a standard deviation ellipse (SDE). Furthermore, the authors used the classical machine-learning k-means algorithm to cluster the temperature attenuation curves to reveal development patterns in different cities. The results showed that the degree of FP expansion during the daytime was more apparent than at night, the area of urban growth positively correlated with a city’s population level, and from 2005 to 2018 (the period of the study), the spatial evolution for all cities showed an overall trend from east to west. These cities were divided roughly into three development patterns by clustering their 2018 temperature attenuation curves. These findings can provide a scientific basis for formulating effective land-use policies by giving a deeper understanding of the spatiotemporal changes in the SUHI FPs and their relationship with land cover in the YRDUA. © 2021 by the authors.

As a result, worldwide cities face the need to integrate data from different transportation modes to dynamically respond to changing conditions. This article combines statistical views with machine learning advances to comprehensively explore changing urban mobility dynamics within multimodal public transportation systems from user trip records. In particular, we retrieve discriminative traffic patterns with order-preserving coherence to model disruptions to demand expectations across geographies and show their utility to describe changing mobility dynamics with strict guarantees of statistical significance, interpretability and actionability. This methodology is applied to comprehensively trace the changes to the urban mobility patterns in the Lisbon city brought by the current COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, we consider passenger trip data gathered from the three major public transportation modes: subway, bus, and tramways. The gathered results comprehensively reveal novel travel patterns within the city, such as imbalanced demand distribution towards the city peripheries, going far beyond simplistic localized changes to the magnitude of traffic demand. This work offers a novel methodological contribution with a solid statistical ground for the spatiotemporal assessment of actionable mobility changes and provides essential insights for other cities and public transport operators facing mobility challenges alike. © 2021 by the authors.

Cities that are already suffering from the urban heat island (UHI) effect, which will withstand the worst of these more extreme heat events. The extent of the impermeable layer and changes in LST are inextricably linked to the severity and commencement of UHI events, which can be measured using the urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI). Land use/Land cover (LULC) change was assessed using support vector machine (SVM) supervised classification, seasonal (summer and winter) LST, and UTFVI variations from Landsat 4–5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI satellite images for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020. Furthermore, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, the cellular automata-based artificial neural network (CA-ANN) algorithm was utilized to forecast LULC, seasonal LST and UTFVI for 2030. From 2000 to 2020, the results demonstrated a large net change in urban areas (+20.52%), whereas vegetation, bare land, and water bodies were all decreased with net changes of -5.72%, -11.19%, and -3.6%, respectively. According to projected LSTs, the net increase in summer and winter temperatures from 2020 to 2030 will be 13% and 20%, respectively, in the highest temperature group (greater than 35 °C). Furthermore, the projected UTFVI showed that in 2030, roughly 72% (up from 58% in 2020) and 69% (up from 47 percent% in 2020) of total area will be covered by stronger and strongest UTFVI zones. Correlation analysis was statistically significant (p value < 0.05), and the relationship between LST and NDBI was strong and positive, but strongly negative with NDVI. The accuracy examination of all the maps revealed a high degree of estimating, with kappa values of more than 80%. By giving significant insights on urban settings and promoting city competency, the study will broaden the perspectives of city planners and policymakers. © 2021 The Author(s)","The authors would like express their gratitude to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Explorer for providing the Landsat archives.

However, human perception (e.g., imageability) have a subtle relationship to visual elements that cannot be fully captured using view indices. Conversely, subjective measures using survey and interview data explain human behaviors more. However, the effectiveness of integrating subjective measures with SVI datasets has been less discussed. To address this, we integrated crowdsourcing, CV, and machine learning (ML) to subjectively measure four important perceptions suggested by classical urban design theory. We first collected ratings from experts on sample SVIs regarding these four qualities, which became the training labels. CV segmentation was applied to SVI samples extracting streetscape view indices as the explanatory variables. We then trained ML models and achieved high accuracy in predicting scores. We found a strong correlation between the predicted complexity score and the density of urban amenities and services points of interest (POI), which validates the effectiveness of subjective measures. In addition, to test the generalizability of the proposed framework as well as to inform urban renewal strategies, we compared the measured qualities in Pudong to other five urban cores that are renowned worldwide. Rather than predicting perceptual scores directly from generic image features using a convolution neural network, our approach follows what urban design theory has suggested and confirmed as various streetscape features affecting multi-dimensional human perceptions. Therefore, the results provide more interpretable and actionable implications for policymakers and city planners. © 2021 by the authors.

Several efforts have been made in this direction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), demonstrating that they are an accurate alternative to numerical approaches when modelling large time series. However, existing approaches are varied, and it is unclear how much data are needed to train them. This study explores whether the need for training data can be reduced without overly compromising model accuracy, and if model reliability can be increased by selecting the UHI intensity as the main model output instead of air temperature. These two approaches were compared using a common ANN configuration and under different data availability scenarios. Results show that reducing the training dataset from 12 to 9 or even 6 months would still produce reliable results, particularly if the UHI intensity is used. The latter proved to be more effective than the temperature approach under most training scenarios, with an average RMSE improvement of 16.4% when using only 3 months of data. These findings have important implications for urban climate research as they can potentially reduce the duration and cost of field measurement campaigns. © 2021 by the author.

A case study, based on Davis AI engine operation versus human maintenance operation is performed on the efficiency of artificial intelligence agents in detecting faulty operation, in the context of growing complexity of communications networks, and the perspective of future development of internet of things, big data, smart cities, and connected vehicles. (*). In the second part of the article, a new solution is proposed for the detection of applications faults or unauthorized intrusions in traffic of communications networks. The first objective of the proposed method is to propose an approach for predicting time series. This approach is based on a multi-resolution decomposition of the signals employing the undecimate wavelet transform (UWT). The second approach for assessing traffic flow is based on the analysis of long-range dependence (LRD) (for this case, a long-term dependence). Estimating the degree of long-range dependence is performed by estimating the Hurst parameter of the analyzed time series. This is a relatively new statistical con-cept in communications traffic analysis and can be implemented using UWT. This property has important implications for network performance, design, and sizing. The presence of long-range dependency in network traffic is assumed to have a significant impact on network performance, and the occurrence of LRD can be the result of faults that occur during certain periods. The strategy chosen for this purpose is based on long-term dependence on traffic, and for the prediction of faults occurrence, a predictive control model (MPC) is proposed, combined with a neural network with radial function (RBF). It is demonstrated via simulations that, in the case of communications traffic, time location is the most important feature of the proposed algorithm. © 2021 by the authors.

Their growing number increases the demand for robust and intelligent solutions providing relevant data, while relying on as few resources as possible. To this end, it is essential to search for techniques and solutions that can achieve a high level of quality of service, using the least hardware and cost. Machine learning can tackle the challenge by generating virtual data. It aims on replicating a sensor’s activity by utilizing real data from a subset of sensors. Such a task could be difficult with existing means, while the proposed approach might reduce it to a trivial calculation. In a similar fashion, it is possible to use simulation models for data analysis and model validation, by feeding the existing simulation models with varying conditions and comparing the results with the real ones.

Diverse very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing images are now available, enabling explicit extraction of urban road vector maps over wide areas. Urban road vectorization mapping consists of two separate tasks: road extraction and road vectorization. The traditional methods focus on the road extraction task, and can obtain a good performance when using a pixel-based metric. However, the road vectorization methods are faced with the problem of road connectivity. In this work, to implement urban road vectorization mapping in a unified way, an end-to-end road vectorization mapping network (RVMNet) framework is proposed. The proposed RVMNet framework consists of a node proposal network (NPN) module and a node connectivity based road refinement module. In the NPN module, a fully convolutional network is adopted for the road node extraction. This improves the connectivity of the road mask by providing supervised information in the form of the road nodes, which are actually part of the road mask. The road mask is then converted into a road vector map by vectorization. In the node connectivity based road refinement module, road nodes are inserted into the road vector map to improve the connectivity. We compared RVMNet with the other state-of-the-art road detection methods on two public road datasets (SpaceNet 3 and DeepGlobe). The results of this comparison showed that combining road extraction and road vectorization into a unified framework is an efficient and accurate strategy for urban road vectorization mapping because it can propose road nodes that help to improve the road connectivity. Moreover, we constructed the novel UrbanRoadNet dataset, covering six cities (Beijing city center; Helsinki; Wuhan; Macao; the Wan Chai area of Hong Kong; and Shanghai). We then applied the RVMNet framework to the data from the six cities, obtaining an improvement in the vector-based average path length similarity (APLS) value of 4.1%. The spatial transfer assessments from both the qualitative and quantitative aspects corroborated the robust generalizability of the proposed method, and further verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach for large-scale road vectorization mapping at a very high resolution. It was also found that road vector spatial distribution is a useful way to reflect urban development. © 2021",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85109646118,Yes,Malaysia,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,"CNN, LSTM",Prediction/Forecasting,Compare CNN and LSTM for traffic flow prediction in smart cities,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Medium

However, users want more of these services that make their lives easier and more sophisticated. Traffic congestion is one of the most common problems that smart cities seek to solve by employing many IoT technologies and artificial intelligence algorithms, in addition to costly infrastructure development processes. This research highlights that parking in some streets and vital places in cities is an important factor in traffic congestion. It also introduces the idea of an intelligent system to solve this problem by enabling the automatic pre-reservation process for vacant positions by users before reaching the venue and then adjusting the process based on automatic detection of the composite plate using a proposed web application based on the OCR algorithm.

Impervious surfaces are major components of urban infrastructures and their expansion represents urban development. These surfaces mainly include built-up areas and streets; they are composed of various materials and found in diverse sizes and shapes. Impervious surface detection is challenging due to the confusion of these surfaces with other land cover classes. These confusions are not constant over different seasons, as seasonality affects the target's responses. This study particularly focused on the seasonal effect on impervious surface detection using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images to find the optimum season. The study area is the city of Sanandaj, in the west of Iran. All processes have been executed on the Google Earth Engine as it provides a platform to access and process the satellite images. To exclude the effect of the classification algorithm on the obtained results, three commonly used classifiers have been compared; i.e., maximum likelihood, support vector machine, and neural network. The results show that spring is the best season to delineate impervious surfaces from remaining land covers, while the use of winter images does not provide acceptable results. Sentinel-2 results outperform Sentinel-1. Variation in topography and high sensitivity of SAR responses to moisture and volume structure hinder the application of Sentinel-1 images in the heterogeneous urban area. The built-up class has higher producer accuracy as compared to the street class. There was considerable confusion between the street and bare soil classes in both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images. © 2021 COSPAR",The authors acknowledge the Google Earth Engine for providing Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images and computation capabilities.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85108050775,Yes,China,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,GNN (Spatial-Temporal),Prediction/Forecasting,Model citywide traffic flow using spatial-temporal fusion graph neural networks,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Methodological,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Medium

We apply this model to investigate the effects of various transportation networks on the heterogeneous propagation of COVID-19 in China. We further apply it to predict the development of COVID-19 in China in two scenarios, i.e., i) assuming that different types of traffic restriction policies are conducted and ii) assuming that the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak is in Beijing, so as to illustrate the potential usage of the model in generating various policy insights to help the containment of the further spread of COVID-19. We find that the most effective way to prevent the coronavirus from spreading quickly and extensively is to control the routes linked to the epicenter at the beginning of the pandemic. But if the virus has been widely spread, setting restrictions on hub cities would be much more efficient than imposing the same travel ban across the whole country. We also show that a comprehensive consideration of the epicenter location is necessary for disease control. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Financial supports from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants: 71701094, 71803131) and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC 435-2017-0728, 430-2019-00725) are gratefully acknowledged.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107963298,Yes,China,Safety/Crime,Security & Safety,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Deep Learning (Attention),Classification,Classify actions in surveillance videos using spatial-temporal attention for smart city,"SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 16 (Governance)",Methodological,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Medium

This is generally due to a lack of air quality monitoring networks in the region. Low cost air quality sensors developed locally in sub-Saharan Africa presents a sustainable operating mechanism that may help generate the air monitoring data needed for exposure estimation of air pollution with LUR models. The primary objective of our study is to investigate whether a network of locally developed low-cost air quality sensors can be used in LUR modeling for accurately predicting monthly ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution in urban areas of central and eastern Uganda. Secondarily, we aimed to explore whether the application of machine learning (ML) can improve LUR predictions compared to ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. We used data for the entire year of 2020 from a network of 23 PM2.5 low-cost sensors located in urban municipalities of eastern and central Uganda. Between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, these sensors collected highly time-resolved measurement data of PM2.5 air concentrations. We used monthly-averaged PM2.5 concentration data for LUR prediction modeling of monthly PM2.5 concentrations. We used eight different ML base-learner algorithms as well as ensemble modeling. We applied 5-fold cross validation (80% training/20% test random splits) to evaluate the models with resampling and Root mean squared error (RMSE). The relative explanatory power and accuracy of the ML algorithms were evaluated by comparing coefficient of determination (R2) and RMSE, using OLS as the reference approach. The overall average PM2.5 concentration during the study period was 52.22 μg/m3 (IQR: 38.11, 62.84 μg/m3)—well above World Health Organization PM2.5 ambient air guidelines. From the base-learner and ensemble models, RMSE and R2 values ranged between 7.65 μg/m3 – 16.85 μg/m3 and 0.24–0.84, respectively. Extreme gradient boosting (xgbTree) performed best out of the base learner algorithms (R2 = 0.84; RMSE = 7.65 μg/m3). Model performance from ensemble modeling with Lasso and Elastic-Net Regularized Generalized Linear Models (glmnet) did not outperform xgbTree, but prediction performance was comparable to that of xgbTree. The most important temporal and spatial predictors of monthly PM2.5 levels were monthly precipitation, percent of the population using solid fuels for cooking, distance to Lake Victoria, and greenspace (NDVI) within a 500-m buffer of air monitors. In conclusion, data from locally developed low-cost PM sensors provide evidence that they can be used for spatio-temporal prediction modeling of air pollution exposures in Uganda. Moreover, the non-parametric ML and ensemble approaches to LUR modeling clearly outperformed OLS regression algorithm for the prediction of monthly PM2.5 concentrations. Deploying low-cost air quality sensors in concert with implementation of data quality control measures, can help address the critical need for expanding and improving air quality monitoring in resource-constrained settings of sub-Saharan Africa. These low-cost sensors, in conjunction with non-parametric ML algorithms, may provide a rapid path forward for PM2.5 exposure assessment and to spur air pollution epidemiology research in the region. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Funding text 1: The AirQo research project is made possible through funding from Google.org” title = ""http://Google.org"">Google.org, Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency , National Research Foundation , and Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council .; Funding text 2: We would like to acknowledge the tireless efforts of the AirQo staff who assisted with data collection and data management.

As the enhancement of the urban heat island effect, understanding the cooling efficiency of urban park and associated determinants has become critical for maximizing the ecological benefits of urban ecological infrastructure. In this paper, we measured holistically the cooling efficiency of urban parks from a relative and absolute perspective by using the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS satellite imageries. We adopted two novel cooling effect indices to rank and identify the inefficient park: DEA-based cooling efficiency index for relative efficiency and park cooling intensity index (PCII) for absolute efficiency. A total of 146 urban parks within the Shanghai metropolitan city was selected to conduct the empirical research. The correlation analysis and machine learning techniques (XGBoost) were also used to examine the relationships between the characteristics of parks and two cooling effect indices. The findings revealed that the average cooling efficiency of urban park in summer was approximately 2.7 times higher than that in winter. Park size and vegetation greenness (NDVI) were identified as the dominant factors for park cooling efficiency. Moreover, larger parks with area > 5 ha showed better cooling performance on average. In the current study area, increasing the water body coverage ratio also played an important role on the improvement of cooling effect in both summer and winter. The research findings could provide valuable references for designing urban parks and for urban planning to maximize the cooling benefits and mitigate the UHI effects. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","This work was sponsored by K.C.

Under the condition of protecting user privacy, the federated learning model has become a popular research technology to solve the data islands problems. The edge computing network can be applied to smart city, Internet of vehicles and so on. Federated learning is a framework in which multiple hosts jointly learn a machine learning model. Each work device maintains the local model of its local training dataset, while the master device maintains the global model by aggregating the local models from the work devices. However, it cannot ensure that every local work device is an honest user because of a phenomenon that the hosts has been operated by attacker interferes in the process of local model training. In this paper, we assume that malicious nodes upload unreal learning parameters in the federated learning framework, which the global model will have high error rate. We propose a federated learning parameter aggregating algorithm based on mutual information. We introduced the relevance of model training learning rate to determine the consistency of the training direction of the local and central models at coarse granularity. We aggregated the parameters of the models at fine granularity based on the correlation of the gradients based on the mutual information. The mutual information method is used to calculate the similarity of the gradient trend between the local training model and overall model. We set the trust weight of each work device to reduce the negative impact of malicious nodes.

However, at that time, there were no possibilities for applying biometric or other kinds of tracking and remote technologies to detect and recognize the emotions felt by other people. The 21st century brought forth such opportunities. Nonetheless, even currently, the remotely integrated, emotional, affective and physiological states, arousal and valence (MAPS) of individuals residing or visiting urban areas are very seldom analysed. Meanwhile stakeholder groups are unable to receive digital advice with a goal to upgrade urban areas to be more pleasant, comfortable and sustainable. In such a context, the authors of this study developed an Affective System for Researching Emotions in Public Spaces for Urban Planning (ASP System). This System has added to the body of knowledge on research in several ways. ASP can prove a helpful supplement to urban planning and public participation practice by gathering and analysing MAPS data of passersby, weather conditions, pollution and other data. This unique combination of MAPS data can assist city stakeholders in initiating effective planning solutions based on an inhabitant-centric method. Additionally ASP employs a neuro decision matrix, which assisted in deriving a comprehensive analysis of the urban areas under deliberation by MAPS parameters. This article also submits eight avenues of practical use for urban planners when employing MAPS data and the ASP Method and System. The case studies on cultural heritage sustainability confirm the accuracy of the developed ASP Method and System. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Funding text 1: This research was funded as part of the ‘Regeneration and Optimisation of Cultural Heritage in Creative and Knowledge Cities – ROCK’ project which has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 730280 .

The amalgamation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and pervasive smartphones has become of paramount importance to produce a significant breakthrough in various domains of smart cities, including healthcare, fitness, skill assessment, and personal assistants, to support independent living. The IoT-supported devices capacitate, embedded with sensors, enabled numerous context-aware applications to recognize physical activities. There are some activity recognition applications; however, they are still deficient in recognizing activities accurately. In this paper, a novel framework for human activity recognition (HAR) is proposed using raw readings from a combination of fused smartphone sensors: accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and Google Fit activity tracking module. The proposed framework applies deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) to an extensive training dataset. The latter consists of five activity classes from 12 individuals using a deep recurrent neural network (DRNN). An extensive training dataset is used consisting of five activity classes from a group of 12 individuals. The designed android application (runs in the background) collects data from the smartphone's embedded sensors fused with the Google Fit API to validate the results proposed framework. The proposed framework shows promising results in recognizing human activities compared to other similar studies and achieves an accuracy of 99.43% for activity recognition using DRNN. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105691421,Yes,China,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,Deep Reinforcement Learning,Optimization,Optimize taxi dispatching using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

Second, the block-matching and 3-D filtering methods are developed for an unsharp filter in YCbCr color space for image denoising and sharpening. Finally, pedestrian detection is performed using a convolutional neural network model to complete the surveillance task. Experimental results show that the Minkowski distance measurement index of enhanced images is increased to 0.975, and the detection accuracies, in F-measure and confidence coefficient, reach 0.907 and 0.840, respectively, which are the highest as compared with other image enhancement methods.

Knowing its precision and seasonal variability will affect future studies of urban climate alteration, such as Urban Heat Island (UHI) that allow sustainable decisions that increase the resilience of cities. In this research, the LST of a medium-sized city, Granada (Spain), was determined using six split window (SW) algorithms: three for Landsat 8 and another three for Sentinel 3A and 3B. Data were validated by measurements in situ at different parts of the city, chosen to represent the different land covers established in the Corine Land Cover inventory (2020). This city has a unique geographical situation, substantial pollution and high daily temperature variations, making it very suitable for study. The data validation by means of statistical analysis gave R2 linear fitting coefficients, the mean square error (RMSE), the mean bias error (MBE) and standard deviation. Our results reveal that the methods based on Landsat 8 SW algorithms present higher mean values (8.16 K) than Sentinel 3 (5.07 K) and Sentinel 3B (2.21 K), the differences being even greater during dry periods. Still, the SWs analyzed can be considered effective and reliable for determining the city's LST.

These applications range from smart cities, smart healthcare to intelligent video surveillance, where the primary interest is person monitoring and detection. The amalgamation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and IoT-based techniques maintain a balance between computational cost and efficiency that is essential for next-generation IoT networks. In this context, a real-time IoT-enabled people detection system is introduced. The developed system performs image processing task over the cloud using an internet connection, thus reduces the computational cost by processing high-resolution images over the cloud. For person detection, a pre-trained Cascade RCNN, a deep learning approach is used. It is an object detection architecture, seeks to address discrediting performance with increased Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds. As the architecture is pre-trained with COCO data set and the person body’s appearance in overhead perspective is significantly different; thus, additional training is performed to enhance the detection results. Taking advantage of transfer learning architecture is trained for overhead person images, and the newly trained feature layer is added to the existing architecture. Experimental outcomes reveal that additional training increases the detection architecture’s performance with an accuracy rate of 0.96. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",This work was supported under the framework of international cooperation program managed by the National Research Foundation of Korea (2019K1A3A1A8011295711).,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85104242088,Yes,Pakistan,Safety/Crime,Security & Safety,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"Cascade-RCNN, Transfer Learning",Object Detection,Develop IoT-enabled real-time overhead view person detection system,"SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 16 (Governance)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Past,Longitudinal,Medium

Energy consumption and the efficient use of district heating networks affect the environment, society, and economy. Modern materials to increase buildings’ energy efficiency become necessary. The use of phase change materials (PCM) is a current issue and many researchers’ interest. PCM reduces energy consumption in buildings due to their ability to absorb and release energy. PCM use seems to be highly justified as regards energy efficiency policy-making considering the city's investment scale. Therefore, research was undertaken on the possibility of reducing energy consumption in the city by using PCM in municipal heating networks, as those for which planning can be carried out systemically. The research's original element is integrating geographic systems with artificial intelligence and statistical methods to estimation the probability of improving buildings’ energy efficiency in urban areas based on an identified set of criteria of an interdisciplinary type. The proposed innovative approach was used to analyze the medium-sized city located in Eastern Europe. The results showed that buildings could be classified according to the probability of energy improvement at the limit of 30%.

Privacy-preserving ML training in an aggregation scenario enables a model demander to securely train ML models with the sensitive IoT data gathered from IoT devices. The existing solutions are generally server aided, cannot deal with the collusion threat between the servers or between the servers and data owners, and do not match the delicate environments of IoT. We propose a privacy-preserving ML training framework named Heda that consists of a library of building blocks based on partial homomorphic encryption, which enables constructing multiple privacy-preserving ML training protocols for the aggregation scenario without the assistance of untrusted servers, and defending the security under collusion situations. Rigorous security analysis demonstrates the proposed protocols can protect the privacy of each participant in the honest-but-curious model and guarantee the security under most collusion situations.

Nevertheless, its crucial challenge lies in how to model multiple complicated spatial dependencies between different regions, dynamic temporal laws among different time intervals with external factors such as holidays, events, and weather. Some existing work leverage the long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) to explore temporal relations and spatial relations, respectively; which have outperformed the classical statistical methods. However, it is difficult for these approaches to jointly model spatial and temporal correlations. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic deep hybrid spatio-temporal neural network namely DHSTNet, to predict traffic flows in every region of a city with high accuracy. In particular, our DSHTNet model comprises four properties i.e., closeness volume, daily volume, trend volume, and external branch, respectively. Moreover, the projected model dynamically assigns different weights to various branches and, then, integrate outputs of four properties to produce final prediction outcomes. The model has been evaluated, both for offline and online predictions, using an edge/fog infrastructure where training happens on the remote cloud and prediction occurs at the edge i.e. in the proximity of users. Extensive experiments and evaluation on two real-world datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed model, in terms of high accuracy over prevailing state-of-the-art baseline methods. Moreover, we apply the exaggeration approach based on an attention mechanism to the above model, called as AAtt-DHSTNet; to predict citywide short-term traffic crowd flows; and show its notable performance in the traffic flows prediction. The aggregation method collects information from the related time series, remove redundancy and, thus, increases prediction speed and accuracy. Our empirical evaluation suggests that the AAtt-DHSTNet model is approximately 20.8% and 8.8% more accurate than the DHSTNet technique, for two different real-world traffic datasets. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.","This research is financially supported, in part, by the National Key Research and Development Program (No. 2018AAA0100503, No. 2018AAA0100500), National Science Foundation of China (No. 61772341, No. 61472254, No. 61772338 and No. 61672240), Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission (No. 18511103002, No. 19510760500, 19511101500), the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Foundation for overseas high-level talents of Shenzhen (No. KQJSCX20180329191021388), the Program for Changjiang Young Scholars in the University of China, the Program for China Top Young Talents, the Program for Shanghai Top Young Talents, Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Digital Education Equipment, and SJTU Global Strategic Partnership Fund (2019 SJTU-HKUST).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100123935,Yes,China,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,"CNN, LSTM",Prediction/Forecasting,Predict citywide crowd flows using data aggregation and spatio-temporal correlations in fog computing,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Methodological,Quantitative,Local,Future,Longitudinal,Strong

By employing complex event processing (CEP) systems, valuable information can be extracted from raw data and used for further applications. CEP is a stream processing technology that matches atomic events to complex events via predefined rules mostly created by experts. However, especially in heterogeneous IoT environments, it may become extremely hard to define these rules manually due to complex and dynamic nature of data. Defining rules requires accurate knowledge of relevant events by utilizing temporal dependencies and relations among attributes of events. Therefore, there is a need for an automatic rule extraction system which is capable of generating rules automatically from unlabeled IoT data. This paper proposes a generalized framework for automatic CEP rule extraction with the help of deep learning (DL) methods. The proposed framework contains two main phases which are data labeling and automatic rule extraction phases. We compare several DL methods with each other and regression-based methods to evaluate the proposed framework. In addition, several rule mining methods are employed in the automatic rule extraction phase in a comparative manner. The reconstruction error and prediction success rate of our framework are evaluated using an air quality dataset collected from a smart city application. The results indicate that the proposed framework is able to generate meaningful and accurate rules for unlabeled IoT data. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099948174,Yes,Turkey,Infrastructure,Smart City Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Deep Learning,Classification,Develop deep learning-based CEP rule extraction framework for IoT data,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Methodological,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

Meeting the demand for these resources can be challenging and it requires an understanding of the consumption patterns. In this study, we apply extreme gradient boosting to predict and analyze electricity, gas, and water consumption in large-scale buildings in New York City and use SHapley Additive exPlanation to interpret the results. For this, the New York City's local law 84 extensive dataset was merged with the Primary Land Use Tax Lot Output dataset as well as with other socio-economic datasets. Specifically, we developed and validated three models: electricity, gas, and water consumption. Overall, we find that electricity, gas, and water consumptions are highly interrelated, but the interrelationships are complex and not universal. The main factor influencing these interrelationships seems to be the technology used for space and water heating (i.e., electricity vs. gas). Building type also has a large impact on interrelationships (i.e., residential vs. nonresidential), especially between electricity and water. Moreover, we also find a nonlinear relationship between gas consumption and building intensity. The main results are summarized into seven major findings. Overall, this study contributes to the urban metabolism literature that ultimately aims to gain a fundamental understanding of how energy and resources are consumed in cities. © 2021 by Yale University",information National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER award #1551731This research was partly supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER award #1551731.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099396235,Yes,United States,Energy,Smart Grid & Energy,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,"XGBoost, SHAP",Prediction/Forecasting,"Analyze interrelationships between electricity, gas and water consumption in large buildings","SDG 6 (Water), SDG 7 (Energy), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

However, depicting mixed land use is rather difficult due to its complexities. Previous studies have decomposed urban land areas using either remote sensing images or geospatial big data. Few studies have combined these two data sources because of the lack of methodologies. This article proposed an end-to-end two-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) for combining features (CF-CNN) to estimate the proportion of mixed land use by integrating high spatial resolution (HSR) images and geospatial big data of real-time Tencent user density (RTUD) data. Two deep learning networks, one for image information extraction and other for human activity-related information extraction, are used to construct two branches of CF-CNN. The mixed land use can be described by calculating the proportions of each land use type at the street-block level. Compared with methods for using single-source data, CF-CNN obtained the highest classification accuracy. We further applied the Shannon diversity index (SHDI) to quantify the agglomerated urban mixed land use. The Spearman correlation coefficients among the SHDI, community distance, and neighborhood vibrancy were calculated to verify the effectiveness of the mixed land use composition. Our framework provided an alternative way of identifying mixed land use structures by integrating multisource data. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Manuscript received February 25, 2020; revised April 22, 2020, June 14, 2020, and August 15, 2020; accepted September 26, 2020.

APTN first uses an encoder attention mechanism to model both the spatial and periodical dependencies. Our model can capture these dependencies more easily because every node attends to all other nodes in the network, which brings regularization effect to the model and avoids overfitting between nodes. Then, a temporal attention is applied to select relevant encoder hidden states across all time steps. We evaluate our proposed model using real world traffic datasets and observe consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Manuscript received July 6, 2019; revised December 6, 2019 and February 27, 2020; accepted March 23, 2020.

Recently, with the rapid development in urbanization, massive video surveillance data are produced at an unprecedented speed. A traditional solution to deal with the big data would require a large amount of computing and storage resources. With the advances in Internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence, and communication technologies, edge computing offers a new solution to the problem by processing all or part of the data locally at the edge of a surveillance system. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using edge computing for smart parking surveillance tasks, specifically, parking occupancy detection using the real-time video feed. The system processing pipeline is carefully designed with the consideration of flexibility, online surveillance, data transmission, detection accuracy, and system reliability. It enables artificial intelligence at the edge by implementing an enhanced single shot multibox detector (SSD). A few more algorithms are developed either locally at the edge of the system or on the centralized data server targeting optimal system efficiency and accuracy. Thorough field tests were conducted in the Angle Lake parking garage for three months. The experimental results are promising that the final detection method achieves over 95% accuracy in real-world scenarios with high efficiency and reliability.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have attracted increasing interest in object detection due to their potential to provide high accuracy detection performance in challenging scenarios. However, DNNs involve high computational complexity and are therefore challenging to deploy under the tighter resource constraints of edge cloud environments compared to more resource-abundant platforms, such as conventional cloud computing platforms. Moreover, the monolithic structure of conventional DNN implementations limits their utility under the dynamically changing operational conditions that are typical in edge cloud computing. In this paper, we address these challenges and limitations of conventional DNN implementation techniques by introducing a new resource-adaptive scheme for DNN-based object detection. This scheme applies the recently-introduced concept of elastic neural networks, which involves the incorporation of multiple outputs within intermediate stages of the neural network backbone. We demonstrate a novel elastic DNN design for object detection, and we show how other methods for streamlining resource requirements, in particular network pruning, can be applied in conjunction with the proposed elastic network approach. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the ability of our methods to efficiently trade-off computational complexity and object detection accuracy for scalable deployment. © © 2021 Hector, Umar, Mehmood, Li and Bhattacharyya.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123075040,Yes,United States,Infrastructure,Smart City Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Deep Neural Networks,Object Detection,Develop scalable object detection for edge cloud environments in smart cities,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Methodological,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

Many Ambient Assisted Living systems are coupled with Android Apps for command-and-control purposes. Consequently, the privacy and security of Ambient Assisted Living systems depend on the privacy and security of the corresponding Android Apps, which follow a privacy self-management model. Unfortunately, the privacy self-management model ignores the decision-making abilities of the elderly and increases their cognitive loads, which put their privacy protection and wellbeing at stake. In this paper, we follow a Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence inspired approach for addressing these issues.

Most of the existing methods for traffic congestion prediction was designed for a specific location. The parameters need to be modified when applying these methods to different locations. Other studies on the traffic network require sophisticated data pre-processing such as map matching. In this paper, we build a model named Relative Position Congestion Tensor and propose a Predictor for Position Congestion Tensor for traffic congestion prediction. First, we design a novel approach to construct congestion matrix on region traffic networks using the concept of relative locations for road nodes and convert matrices into three-dimensional spatio-temporal tensors. Then, we propose a method based on convolutional long-short term memory network to predict congestion at all locations of the road network in the near future. The experiments show that in all locations where congestion often occurs, the proposed method significantly outperforms baseline models including Linear Regression, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Regression, Long-Short Term Memory and generally outperforms the Convolution-based deep Neural Network modeling Periodic traffic data.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have for last two decades received considerable attention in building smart and effective system with wider coverage using low cost, highly flexible unmanned platform for smart city infrastructure. Unlike fixed monitoring devices, the camera platform of aerial vehicles has many constraints, as it is in constant motion including titling and panning, and thus makes it difficult to process data for real time applications. The inaccuracy in object detection rates from UAV videos has motivated the research community to combine different approaches such as optical flow and supervised learning algorithms. The method proposed in this research incorporates steps that include Kanade-Lucas optical flow method for moving object detection, building connected graphs to isolate objects and convolutional neural network (CNN), followed by support vector machine (SVM) for final classification. The generated optical flow contains background (and tiny) objects detected as vehicle as the camera platform moves. The classifier introduced here rules out the presence of any other (moving) objects to be detected as vehicles. The methodology adopted is tested on a stationary and moving aerial videos.

The underlying assumption is that these images are independent of one another in terms of geographic spatial information. However, it is well known that many land-cover or land-use categories share common regional characteristics within a certain spatial scale. For example, the style of buildings may change from one city or country to another. In this paper, we explore some deep learning approaches integrated with geospatial hash codes to improve the semantic segmentation results of satellite images. Specifically, the geographic coordinates of satellite images are encoded into a string of binary codes using the geohash method. Then, the binary codes of the geographic coordinates are fed into the deep neural network using three different methods in order to enhance the semantic segmentation ability of the deep neural network for satellite images. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of embedding geographic coordinates into the neural networks.

To reflect this, previous grid-based crime prediction studies combined all the cells surrounding the event location to be predicted for use in model training. However, the actual land is continuous rather than a set of independent cells as in a geographic information system. Because the patterns that occur according to the detailed method of crime vary, it is necessary to reflect the spatial characteristics of the adjacent land in crime prediction. In this study, cells with similar spatial characteristics were classified using the Max-p region model (a spatial clustering technique), and the performance was compared to the existing method using random forest (a tree-based machine learning model). According to the results, the F1 score of the model using spatial clustering increased by approximately 2%. Accordingly, there are differences in the physical environmental factors influenced by the detailed method of crime. The findings reveal that crime involving the same offender is likely to occur around the area of the original crime, indicating that a repeated crime is likely in areas with similar spatial features to the area where the crime occurred. © 2021 by the authors.

When the collected data is published for valuable information mining, privacy turns out to be a key matter due to the presence of sensitive information. Such sensitive information comprises either a single sensitive attribute (an individual has only one sensitive attribute) or multiple sensitive attributes (an individual can have multiple sensitive attributes). Anonymization of data sets with multiple sensitive attributes presents some unique problems due to the correlation among these attributes. Artificial intelligence techniques can help the data publishers in anonymizing such data. To the best of our knowledge, no fuzzy logic-based privacy model has been proposed until now for privacy preservation of multiple sensitive attributes. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy preserving model F-Classify that uses fuzzy logic for the classification of quasi-identifier and multiple sensitive attributes. Classes are defined based on defined rules, and every tuple is assigned to its class according to attribute value. The working of the F-Classify Algorithm is also verified using HLPN. A wide range of experiments on healthcare data sets acknowledged that F-Classify surpasses its counterparts in terms of privacy and utility.

People shift themselves and their families to urban areas for the sake of better education and a mod-ern lifestyle. Due to rapid urbanization, cities are facing huge challenges, one of which is waste management, as the volume of waste is directly proportional to the people living in the city. The municipalities and the city administrations use the traditional wastage classification techniques which are manual, very slow, inefficient and costly. Therefore, automatic waste classification and management is essential for the cities that are being urbanized for the better recycling of waste. Better recycling of waste gives the opportunity to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills by reducing the need to collect new raw material. In this paper, the idea of a real‐time smart waste classification model is presented that uses a hybrid approach to classify waste into various classes. Two machine learning models, a multilayer perceptron and multilayer convolutional neural network (ML‐CNN), are implemented. The multilayer perceptron is used to provide binary classifica-tion, i.e., metal or non‐metal waste, and the CNN identifies the class of non‐metal waste. A camera is placed in front of the waste conveyor belt, which takes a picture of the waste and classifies it. Upon successful classification, an automatic hand hammer is used to push the waste into the as-signed labeled bucket. Experiments were carried out in a real‐time environment with image seg-mentation. The training, testing, and validation accuracy of the purposed model was 0.99% under different training batches with different input features. © 2021 by the authors.

It is still challenging to extract accurate vegetation covers from aerial imagery using traditional classification approaches, because urban vegetation categories have complex spatial structures and similar spectral properties. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown a significant improvement in remote sensing image classification outcomes during the last few years. These methods are promising in this domain, yet unreliable for various reasons, such as the use of irrelevant descriptor features in the building of the models and lack of quality in the labeled image. Explainable AI (XAI) can help us gain insight into these limits and, as a result, adjust the training dataset and model as needed. Thus, in this work, we explain how an explanation model called Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) can be utilized for interpreting the output of the DNN model that is designed for classifying vegetation covers. We want to not only produce high-quality vegetation maps, but also rank the input parameters and select appropriate features for classification. Therefore, we test our method on vegetation mapping from aerial imagery based on spectral and textural features. Texture features can help overcome the limitations of poor spectral resolution in aerial imagery for vegetation mapping. The model was capable of obtaining an overall accuracy (OA) of 94.44% for vegetation cover mapping. The conclusions derived from SHAP plots demonstrate the high contribution of features, such as Hue, Brightness, GLCM_Dissimilarity, GLCM_Homogeneity, and GLCM_Mean to the output of the proposed model for vegetation mapping. Therefore, the study indicates that existing vegetation mapping strategies based only on spectral characteristics are insufficient to appropriately classify vegetation covers. © 2021 by the authors.

Solutions aiming to guarantee QoS support have not been deployed in large-scale networks. Traffic classification is a mechanism used to manage different aspects, including QoS requirements. However, conventional traffic classification methods, such as the port-based method, are inefficient because of their inability to handle dynamic port allocation and encryption. Traffic classification using machine learning has gained research interest as an alternative method to achieve high performance. In fact, machine learning embeds intelligence into network functions, thus improving network management. In this study, we apply machine learning algorithms to predict network traffic classification. We apply four supervised learning algorithms: support vector machine, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, and decision tree. We also apply a port-based method of traffic classification based on applications’ popular assigned port numbers. Then, we compare the results of this method to those obtained from the machine learning algorithms. The evaluation results indicate that the decision tree algorithm provides the highest average accuracy among the evaluated algorithms, at 99.18%. Moreover, network traffic classification using machine learning provides more accurate results and higher performance than the port-based method. © 2020 by the authors.

UAVs coupled with various sensors can perform many cognitive tasks such as object detection, surveillance, traffic management, and urban planning. Deep learning has emerged as a popular technique to speed up the processing of high-dimensional data like images and videos, which has led to several applications in surveillance and autonomous driving. However, the area of aerial object detection has been understudied. This work proposes a deep learning approach for detection of objects in aerial scenes captured by UAVs. Our work first categorizes the current methods for aerial object detection using deep learning techniques and discusses how the task is different from general object detection scenarios. We delineate the specific challenges involved and experimentally demonstrate the key design decisions that significantly affect the accuracy and robustness of models.

Through collaborative content sharing, the storage limitation of a single edge server (ES) can be broken. However, when mobile users need to download the whole content through multiple regions, independently deciding the caching content for ESs in different regions may result in redundant caching. Furthermore, frequent switching of communication connection during user movement also causes retransmission delay. As a revolutionary approach in the artificial intelligence field, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has earned great success in solving high-dimensional and network resource management related problems. Therefore, we integrate collaborative caching and DRL to build an intelligent edge caching framework, so as to realize collaborative caching between cloud and ESs. In this caching framework, a fed-erated-machine-learning-based user behavior prediction model is first designed to characterize the content preference and movement trajectory of mobile users. Next, to achieve efficient resource aggregation of ESs, a user-behavior-aware dynamic collaborative caching domain (DCCD) construction and management mechanism is devised to divide ESs into clusters, select cluster heads, and set the re-clustering rules. Then a DRL-based content caching and delivery algorithm is presented to decide the caching content of ESs in a DCCD from a global perspective and plan the transmission path for users, which reduces redundant content and transmission delay. Especially when a user request cannot be satisfied by the current DCCD, a cross-domain content delivery strategy is presented to allow ESs in other DCCDs to provide and forward content to the user, avoiding the traffic pressure and delay caused by requesting services from cloud. The simulation results show that the proposed collaborative caching framework can improve user satisfaction in terms of content hit rate and service delay. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","AcknowledgMents This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2020AAA0140102), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (62071070), and the Innovative Development Project of Industrial Internet (Construction of Industrial Internet Test Bed Based on Ubiquitous Power Internet of Things).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85113375570,Yes,China,Infrastructure,Smart City Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Deep Reinforcement Learning,Optimization,Develop mobile edge collaborative caching framework using deep reinforcement learning,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Longitudinal,Medium

IoT networks allow distributed smart devices to collect and process data within smart city infrastructure using an open channel, the Internet. Thus, challenges such as centralization, security, privacy (e.g., performing data poisoning and inference attacks), transparency, scalability, and verifiability limits faster adaptations of smart cities. Motivated by the aforementioned discussions, we present a Privacy-Preserving and Secure Framework (PPSF) for IoT-driven smart cities. The proposed PPSF is based on two key mechanisms: A two-level privacy scheme and an intrusion detection scheme. First, in a two-level privacy scheme, a blockchain module is designed to securely transmit the IoT data and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique is applied to transform raw IoT information into a new shape. In the intrusion detection scheme, a Gradient Boosting Anomaly Detector (GBAD) is applied for training and evaluating the proposed two-level privacy scheme based on two IoT network datasets, namely ToN-IoT and BoT-IoT. We also suggest a blockchain-InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) integrated Fog-Cloud architecture to deploy the proposed PPSF framework.

While the massive deployment of connected devices offers opportunities to improve quality of life and to develop new services, the impact of such devices on the security of the users in a context where the level of malicious threat continues to increase is a major concern. One of the challenges is the heterogeneity and constant evolution of wireless technologies and protocols used. To overcome this problem, we propose RIDS, a Radio Intrusion Detection System that is based on the monitoring and profiling of radio communications at the physical layer level using autoencoder neural networks. RIDS is independent of the wireless protocols and modulation technologies used. Besides, it is designed to provide a threefold diagnosis of the detected anomalies: temporal (start and end date of the detected anomaly), frequential (main frequency of the anomaly), and spatial (location of the origin of the anomaly). To demonstrate the relevance and the efficiency of our approach, we collected a large dataset of radio-communications recorded with three different probes deployed in an experimental room. Multiple real-world attacks involving a wide variety of communication technologies are also injected to assess the detection and diagnosis efficiency. The results demonstrate the efficiency of RIDS in detecting and diagnosing anomalies that occurred in the 400-500 Mhz and 800-900 Mhz frequency bands.

Additionally, it presents a low-cost wireless sensor network (WSN) to collect the data and give the occupancy inference. We collect the environment data, with the presented WSN, in our university's laboratory. To verify the robustness of algorithms, we randomly insert anomalous sensor readings in the collected data through a Bernoulli distribution process. These anomalies represent different environment events or sensor failures. With these data, we evaluate the random forest (RF), classification and regression tree (Cart), and K-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithms. The best performing algorithms were RF and k-NN, presenting close to 99% of accuracy in data without anomalies and 97% in data with 10% of anomalies.

Street view is the most common scene during driving. Since streets are often full of shops with signboards, scene text recognition over the shop sign images in street views is of great significance and utility to urban scene understanding in ITS. To advance research in this field, (1) we build ShopSign, which is a large-scale scene text dataset of Chinese shop signs in street views. It contains 25,770 natural scene images, and 267,049 text instances. The images in ShopSign were captured in different scenes, from downtown to developing regions, and across 8 provinces and 20 cities in China, using more than 50 different mobile phones. It is very sparse and imbalanced in nature. (2) we carry out a comprehensive empirical study on the performance of state-of-the-art DL based scene text reading algorithms on ShopSign and three other Chinese scene text datasets, which has not been addressed in the literature before. Through comparative analysis, we demonstrate that language has a critical influence on scene text detection. Moreover, by comparing the accuracy of four scene text recognition algorithms, we show that there is a very large room for further improvements in street view text recognition to fit real-world ITS applications. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Manuscript received May 27, 2020; revised July 27, 2020; accepted August 13, 2020.

Predicting trajectories starting from Floating Car Data (FCD) is a complex task that comes with different challenges, namely Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) interaction, Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) interaction, multimodality, and generalizability. These challenges, especially, have not been completely explored by state-of-the-art works. In particular, multimodality and generalizability have been neglected the most, and this work attempts to fill this gap by proposing and defining new datasets, metrics, and methods to help understand and predict vehicle trajectories. We propose and compare Deep Learning models based on Long Short-Term Memory and Generative Adversarial Network architectures; in particular, our GAN-3 model can be used to generate multiple predictions in multimodal scenarios. These approaches are evaluated with our newly proposed error metrics N-ADE and N-FDE, which normalize some biases in the standard Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE) metrics. Experiments have been conducted using newly collected datasets in four large Italian cities (Rome, Milan, Naples, and Turin), considering different trajectory lengths to analyze error growth over a larger number of time-steps. The results prove that, although LSTM-based models are superior in unimodal scenarios, generative models perform best in those where the effects of multimodality are higher. Space-time and geographical analysis are performed, to prove the suitability of the proposed methodology for real cases and management services. © 2021 Rossi et al.

In this study, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was utilized to classify the land use land cover (LULC) maps for 1990, 2000, and 2018. The LULCs dynamics in 1990–2000, 2000–2018, and 1990–2018 were computed using delta (Δ) change and Markovian transitional probability matrix. The future LULC map for 2028 was predicted using the artificial neural network-cellular automata model (ANN-CA). The machine learning algorithms, such as random forest (RF), classification and regression tree (CART), and probability distribution function (PDF) were utilized to perform sensitivity analysis. Pearson’s correlation technique was used to explore the correlation between the predicted models and their driving variables. The ecosystem health conditions for 1990–2028 were predicted by integrating the fuzzy inference system with the VORS model. The results of LULC maps showed that urban areas increased by 334.4% between 1990 and 2018. Except for dense vegetation, all the natural resources and generated ecosystem services have been decreased significantly due to the rapid and continuous urbanization process. A future LULC map (2028) showed that the built-up area would be 343.72 km2. The new urban area in 2028 would be 169 km2. All techniques for sensitivity analysis showed that proximity to urban areas, vegetation, and scrubland are highly sensitive to land suitability models to simulate and predict LULC maps of 2018 and 2028. Global sensitivity analysis showed that fragmentation or organization was the most sensitive parameter for ecosystem health conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, as one of the most developed megacities in China, sets up a goal of high-quality development while fostering ecosystem services. Therefore, assessing the ecosystem services in this study area is very important to guide further development. However, the spatial pattern of ecosystem services, especially at local scales, is not well understood. Using the available 2017 land cover product, Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical images, a deep learning land cover mapping framework integrating deep change vector analysis and the ResUnet model was proposed. Based on the produced 10 m land cover map for the year 2020, recent spatial patterns of the ecosystem services at different scales (i.e., the GBA, 11 cities, urban–rural gradient, and pixel) were analyzed. The results showed that: (1) Forest was the primary land cover in Guangzhou, Huizhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Jiangmen, Zhaoqing, and Hong Kong, and an impervious surface was the main land cover in the other four cities. (2) Although ecosystem services in the GBA were sufficient to meet their demand, there was undersupply for all the three general services in Macao and for the provision services in Zhongshan, Dongguan, Shenzhen, and Foshan. (3) Along the urban–rural gradient in the GBA, supply and demand capacity showed an increasing and decreasing trend, respectively. As for the city-level analysis, Huizhou and Zhuhai showed a fluctuation pattern while Jiangmen, Zhaoqing, and Hong Kong presented a decreasing pattern along the gradient. (4) Inclusion of neighborhood landscape led to increased demand scores in a small proportion of impervious areas and oversupply for a very large percent of bare land. © 2021 by the authors.

Air pollution contributes to critical environmental problems in various towns and cities. With the emergence of the smart city concept, appropriate methods to curb exposure to pollutants must be part of an appropriate urban development policy. This study presents a technologically driven air quality solution for smart cities that advertises energy-efficient and cleaner sequestration in these areas. It attempts to explore how to incorporate data-driven approaches and citizen participation into effective public sector pollution management in smart cities as a major component of the smart city definition. The smart city idea was developed as cities became more widespread through communication devices. This study addresses the technical criteria for implementing a framework that public administration can use to prepare for renovation of public buildings, minimizing energy use and costs and linking smart police stations to monitor air pollution as a part of an integrated city. Such a digital transition in resource management will increase public governance energy performance and provide a higher standard for operations and a healthier environment. The study results indicate that complex processes lead to efficient and sustainable smart cities. This research discovered an interpretive pattern in how public agencies, private enterprises, and community members think and what they do in these regional contexts.

Meanwhile, we can now able to collect, store, and analyze a large amount of sharing bike data. How to effectively use these massive data to provide better services is an emerging task. However, due to the skewed and imbalanced bike usages for stations located at different places, it is of great significance yet very challenging to predict the potential destinations of each individual trip beforehand so that the service providers can better schedule manual bike re-dispatch in advance. To address this issue, this paper proposes an attention-based deep learning framework for trip destination prediction (AFTER). AFTER first learns the low-dimension representations of users and sharing bike stations via negative sampling strategies. Then, a convolution neural network with an attention mechanism is utilized to predict the future trip destination. Experimental results on a real-world dataset indicate that the proposed framework outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in terms of precision, recall, and F1. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Manuscript received March 29, 2020; revised June 12, 2020; accepted July 6, 2020.

The reason is its limitations in adapting the dynamically changing information of users, tasks, access policies and resources in such applications. It also does not incorporate semantically meaningful business roles, which could have a diverse impact upon access decisions in such multi-domain collaborative business environments. We propose an Intelligent Role-based Access Control (I-RBAC) model that uses intelligent software agents for achieving intelligent access control in such highly dynamic multi-domain environments. The novelty of this model lies in using a core I-RBAC ontology that is developed using real-world semantic business roles as occupational roles provided by Standard Occupational Classification (SOC), USA. It contains around 1400 business roles, from nearly all domains, along with their detailed task descriptions as well as hierarchical relationships among them. The semantic role mining process is performed through intelligent agents that use word embedding and a bidirectional LSTM deep neural network for automated population of organizational ontology from its unstructured text policy and, subsequently, matching this ontology with core I-RBAC ontology to extract unified business roles. The experimentation was performed on a large number of collaboration case scenarios of five multi-domain organizations and promising results were obtained regarding the accuracy of automatically derived RDF triples (Subject, Predicate, Object) from organizational text policies as well as the accuracy of extracted semantically meaningful roles. © 2021 by the authors.

The aggregation is commonly done with sum or concatenation (concat) followed by convolutional (conv) layers. However, it fully passes down the high-level context to the following hierarchy without considering their interrelation. In this work, we aim to enable the low-level feature to aggregate the complementary context from adjacent high-level feature maps by a cross-scale pixel-to-region relation operation. We leverage cross-scale context propagation to make the long-range dependency capturable even by the high-resolution low-level features. To this end, we employ an efficient feature pyramid network to obtain multi-scale features. We propose a Relational Semantics Extractor (RSE) and Relational Semantics Propagator (RSP) for context extraction and propagation respectively. Then we stack several RSP into an RSP head to achieve the progressive top-down distribution of the context. Experiment results on two challenging datasets Cityscapes and COCO demonstrate that the RSP head performs competitively on both semantic segmentation and panoptic segmentation with high efficiency.

In recent years, Points of Interest (POI) data, with precise geolocation and detailed attributes, have become the primary data source for exploring urban functional use from a bottom-up perspective, using local, highly disaggregated, big datasets. Previous studies using POI data have given insufficient consideration to the relationship among POI classes in the spatial context, and have failed to provide a straightforward means by which to classify urban functional areas. This study proposes an approach for delineating urban functional use at the scale of the Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA) in Greater London by integrating the Doc2Vec model, a neural network embedding method commonly used in natural language processing for vectoring words and documents from their context. In this study, the neural network vectorises both POI classes (‘Word’) and urban areas (‘Document’) based on their functional context by learning features from the spatial distribution of POIs in the city. Specifically, we first construct POI sequences based on the distribution of POI classes, and add their LSOA IDs as ‘document’ tags. By utilising these constructed POI–LSOA sequences, the Doc2Vec model trains the vectors of 574 POI classes (word vectors) and 4836 LSOAs (document vectors). The vectors of POI classes are then used in calculating the functional similarity scores based on their cosine distance, with the vectors of LSOAs grouped into clusters (i.e., functional areas) via the k-means clustering algorithm. We also identify latent functions in each cluster of LSOAs by performing topic modelling and enrichment factor. Compared with TF–IDF, LDA and Word2Vec models, the Doc2Vec model obtains the highest accuracy when classifying functional areas. This study proposes a straightforward approach in which the model directly trains vectors for urban areas, subsequently using them to classify urban functional areas. By employing the enhanced neural network model with low-cost and ubiquitous POI datasets, this study provides a potential tool with which to monitor urban dynamics in a timely and adaptive manner, thereby providing enhanced, data-driven support to urban planning, development and management. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Funding text 1: The authors express thanks for the Ordnance Survey, Great Britain for the data used in this work.

Thus, the need for regular monitoring of coastal water quality is becoming increasingly vital, and remote sensing is deemed to be a viable approach particularly due to its cost-effectiveness. Over the past two decades, remote sensing using satellite imaging has already been adopted in various tasks related to the monitoring of coastal hydro-enviro nment, including the detection of oil spills, identification of turbid plumes, mapping of marine ecosystems, etc. Despite their usefulness, space-borne sensors are subjected to constraints such as low spatial resolution, clouds and atmospheric interference, sparse frequency, and inflexible scheduling. Recently, remote sensing with portable Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (pUAVs) is emerging as a promising alternative for high spatial-resolution monitoring of coastal hydro-environment, with the key advantages that they can minimize the effects of atmospheric disruptions and be implemented with a frequent schedule to perform on-demand monitoring. In addition, with the technological advances in the sensor's design, UAVs are now capable of capturing data with fine spectral resolutions, ranging from several (multispectral) to hundreds (hyperspectral) of spectral bands. Data analytic is also improving rapidly with the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning algorithms. In this paper, we present a systematic review of the recent developments in the utilization of UAV-based remote sensing for the sustainable development of the coastal hydro-environment, particularly with pUAVs. The key technical issues, including the design of UAV systems and the processing of data, are examined for specific applications. Future prospects for implementation are also discussed. © 2021",We thank Ms. Trang Ha Nguyen for providing the platform for literature search and analysis.

We propose two deep learning models based on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks with self-attention mechanism—namely, hybrid LSTM and sequential LSTM. These models capture patterns in location and time sequences in trajectory data and their dependencies to predict next locations and travel times simultaneously. Using Bluetooth vehicle trajectory data from Brisbane, Australia, we compare the prediction performance of the proposed models with several existing approaches including hidden Markov model and other LSTM-based models. The results show that the proposed models produce higher prediction accuracy for both location and time prediction tasks, with the sequential LSTM yielding the best performance. Compared to the conventional next location prediction problem, which considers location sequences only without travel time consideration, the study finds that jointly modelling location and travel time sequences actually improves the next location prediction performance itself, potentially because travel time observations capture the information on traffic conditions in the network, which may affect drivers’ location choices. We demonstrate an application of the proposed models in network traffic management, where important locations can be identified to mitigate congestion in a hot-spot by predicting where vehicles come from and go next in an urban road network. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",This research was partially funded by the Australian Research Council under grant DE190101020.

Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) point clouds segmentation and accurate classification are challenging and crucial to produce different geo-information products like three-dimensional (3D) city designs. This paper introduces an effective data-driven approach to build roof superstructures classification for airborne LiDAR point clouds with very low density and imbalanced classes, covering an urban area. Notably, it focuses on building roof superstructures (especially dormers and chimneys) and mitigating nonplanar objects' problems. Also, the imbalanced class problem of LiDAR data, to the best of our knowledge, is not yet addressed in the literature; it is considered in this study. The major advantage of the proposed approach is using only raw data without assumptions on the distribution underlying data. The main methodological novelties of this work are summarized in the following key elements. (i) At first, an adapted connected component analysis for 3D points cloud is proposed. (ii) Twelve geometry-based features are extracted for each component. (iii) A Support Vector Machine (SVM)-driven procedure is applied to classify the 3D components. (iv) Furthermore, a new component size-based sampling (CSBS) method is proposed to treat the imbalanced data problem and has been compared with several existing resampling strategies. In this study, components are classified into five classes: shed and gable dormers, chimneys, ground, and others. The results of this investigation show the satisfying classification performance of the proposed approach. Results also showed that the proposed approach outperformed machine learning methods, including SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Adaboost. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Manuscript received March 26, 2021; accepted April 12, 2021.

In this regard, the human detection system has gained notable attention since it is recognized as a crucial task in intelligent surveillance applications. Researchers practiced a variety of computer vision and deep neural networks-based techniques for human detection-based applications; however, they often focused on the frontal view camera perspective. Thus, in this work, we have introduced a human detection system for intelligent surveillance in smart cities and societies with a completely distinct perspective, i.e., an overhead perspective that can provide sufficient visibility and coverage of a scene in congested and obstructed environments. However, human appearance can be difficult from such an extreme point of view, as there are significant variations in humans’ poses and appearances. Therefore, in this work, leveraging the deep neural network-based object detection technique, the Gaussian YOLOv3 algorithm is used for human detection. The algorithm determines the bounding box uncertainty by modeling its coordinates as a Gaussian parameter, improving accuracy and reducing false positives. A Gaussian YOLOv3 is combined with channel attention and feature intertwine modules to improve specific feature maps. The channel attention module is combined with the feature map to learn each channel's weight autonomously, improve the key features, and enhance the network's ability to discriminate between humans and background. At the same time, different channels of the feature map are intertwined to obtain more representative features. Finally, the features obtained from the attention and feature intertwine modules are fused to form an improved feature map. In addition, to further increase the detection accuracy of the algorithm for human detection, transfer learning is adopted. The experimental outcomes reveal that training improves the Gaussian YOLOv3 algorithm's potential for human detection with an overall detection accuracy of 94%. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Funding text 1: The authors are grateful to King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia for supporting this work through Researchers Supporting Project number RSP-2020/18.

The widespread installation of closed-circuit television cameras and continuously generated video streams are a strategic data source that can contribute toward safety and sustainability through efficient surveillance of smart city assets and resources. Recent advances in deep learning methods are able to detect and localize salient objects in a video stream. However, a number of practical issues remain unaddressed, such as suboptimality, latency, predictive accuracy, and most importantly the contextualization of all detected salient objects for informed decisions that aligns with ethical surveillance. In this article, we propose a Generative Latent Space (GenLS) approach that overcomes these challenges, specifically in road surveillance. We demonstrate an adaptation of this approach for a prominent use-case in road surveillance, License Plate Detection.

The chief problems in any real-globe SE centered upon the IoT model are the security in addition to privacy. The security susceptibility in IoT-centered systems creates security risks that affect SE applications. So, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based Modified Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System is proposed aimed at detecting the attacks on IoT Smart Cities (SM). The proposed method comprises ‘2’ phases. They are training and testing. First, the IDS are trained by performing three processes: preprocessing, feature selection (FS) and classification.

They are the attacked data and non-attacked data. The non-attacked data is sent to the user securely with the help of Improved Rivest Shamir Adleman method. After that, the user receives and decrypts the data. Then, the decrypted data is forecasted for further analysis.

In contrast, this research attempts to examine the question of economic sustainability of human settlement at a local project level. Urban planners need to strike a balance between dispersal and over-concentration of population in cities. The existing theories suggest that either excessively low or extremely high levels of household concentration is undesirable to a neighborhood. In this study, an economic assessment using machine learning (ML) techniques is used to identify the threshold scale of a housing estate, which comprises many privately owned residential units (like condos) with shared amenities. Using two decades of property transaction data in Hong Kong as our evidence, this study has found that a tipping point exists in the development scale of these housing estates. Housing values initially rise with the number of residential units in a housing estate but gradually fall when it increases beyond a critical limit. This nonlinear economic relationship is attributed to the per household share of common facilities, which does not increase sufficiently to match with the growing population density of the housing estates. The policy implication is that, to optimize housing supply, urban planning should not just focus on increasing the development bulk of housing but should also pay attention to the possible bottlenecks in the provision of shared amenities in the neighborhood. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",The work in this study is supported by the General Research Fund of the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (Project Number: 525512 and 17202818).,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099404797,Yes,Hong Kong,Housing,Urban Planning & Land Use,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Machine Learning,Classification,Assess sustainable development scale of housing estates using machine learning,SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities),Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

Recently, mobile vehicles are adopted to perform sensing data collection tasks in the urban city due to their ubiquity and mobility. In this article, we study how mobile vehicles can be optimally selected in order to collect maximum data from the urban environment in a future period of tens of minutes. We formulate the recruitment of vehicles as a maximum data limited budget problem. The application scenario is generalized to a realistic online setting where vehicles are continuously moving in real-time and the data center decides to recruit a set of vehicles immediately. A deep learning-based scheme through mobile vehicles (DLMV) is proposed to collect sensing data in the urban environment. We first propose a deep learning-based offline algorithm to predict vehicle mobility in a future time period. Furthermore, we propose a greedy online algorithm to recruit a subset of vehicles with a limited budget for the NP-Complete problem. Extensive experimental evaluations are conducted on the real mobility dataset in Rome. The results have not only verified the efficiency of our proposed solution but also validated that DLMV can improve the quantity of collected sensing data compared with other algorithms. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Manuscript received January 4, 2020; revised May 2, 2020 and July 16, 2020; accepted September 8, 2020.

However, the existing related research on the above problems generally has the defects of high technical complexity and high cost. Therefore, we aim to propose a way to optimize the setting of urban public transportation stations and reduce the technical complexity and high cost of existing public transportation station optimization by using artificial intelligence algorithms. First, we extract and integrate bus GPS data and bus card swipe data in the business system and perform exploratory analysis on the pre-processed data. Second, the original k-NN algorithm is improved, and an ik-NN algorithm is proposed to determine the cardholder's boarding point. Then, we divide the upstream and downstream lines to calculate the total number of upstream and downstream passengers. Third, we propose an algorithm for calculating the number of passengers getting off at bus stations and calculating the number of passengers getting on and off at each bus station. Finally, according to the number of passengers getting on and off at each bus station, the OD matrix is constructed, the residents' travel rules are analyzed, and optimization suggestions for the setting of urban bus stations are proposed. This paper selects the public transit GPS data set and swipe card data set of Shenzhen, China for experiments. The experimental results show that: (1) Compared with K-means, the ik-NN algorithm we proposed can effectively determine the actual car station of each cardholder, and the algorithm is less sensitive to feature dimensions. At the same time, the ik-NN algorithm has a high operating efficiency and is less affected by the ""k""value. (2) The calculation algorithm for the number of passengers getting off at bus stations can effectively use the existing data of the business system to determine the number of passengers getting off at each bus station. Therefore, the calculation times of this algorithm are low, and the accuracy is high. (3) The optimization suggestions for bus stations based on the OD matrix analysis of residents' travel rules meet the needs of urban development and have certain reference value. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Funding text 1: Grant No. 2017JM5142, project of research on in°uencing factors and promotion strategies of big data governance capability of local governments under Grant No. 2020KRM193 and Ministry of Education Humanities and social sciences research and planning fund project — mechanism analysis and policy construction of environmental regulation to promote high quality development of China's economy under Grant No. 19YJA790085.; Funding text 2: This research was funded by the Shaanxi Natural Science Project — Research on Optimization of Manufacturing Resources in Club Manufacturing Mode under",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103046049,Yes,China,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,"Data Mining, AI",Optimization,Optimize urban bus stops setting based on data mining with GPS and card data,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

In order to solve the problem of road traffic statisties, this paper proposes a residual network based UAV aerial traffic flow measuring algorithm based on residual network. The fully connected multi-scale residual learning block (FMRB) is introduced into the method network to solve the gradient dispersion phenomenon and make the image features better extracted and learned. At present, the accuracy of the existing vehicle detection algorithms is low, and most of them can only detect the vehicle, and can not count the traffic flow. In this paper, combined with video frame estimation method, real-time monitoring and statisties of traffic flow is realized. Compared with SSD, YOLOv2 and YOLOvS algorithms in vehicle detection performance, the results show that, under the condition of self built data set training, this method introduces multi-scale residual learning block (FMRB) for vehicle recognition of remote sensing image, and can achieve higher recognition accuracy.

They mainly find applications in agriculture monitoring, environment monitoring, smart city development and defence. These applications demand high-end performance from the WSN. However, the performance of a WSN is highly vulnerable to various types of security threats. Any intrusion may reduce the performance of the WSN and result in fatal problems. Hence, fast intrusion detection and prevention is of great use. This paper aims towards fast detection and prevention of any intrusion using a machine learning approach based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model. We have proposed three methods (S-GPR, C-GPR and GPR) based on feature scaling for accurate prediction of k-barrier coverage probability. We have selected the number of nodes, sensing range, Sensor to Intruder Velocity Ratio (SIVR), Mobile to Static Node Ratio (MSNR), angle of the intrusion path, and required k as the potential features. These features are extracted using an analytical approach. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method III accurately predicts the k-barrier coverage probability and outperforms the other two methods (I and II) with a correlation coefficient (R = 0.85) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE = 0.095).

Energy consumption is one of the major issues in global and national policies, therefore scientific efforts in creating prediction models of energy consumption and cost are highly important. One of the largest energy consumers in every state is its public sector, consisting of educational, health, public administration, military, and other types of public buildings. Recent technologies based on sensor networks and Big data platforms enable collection of large amounts of data that could be used to analyze energy consumption and cost. A real data from Croatian public sector is used in this paper including a large number of constructional, energetic, occupational, climate and other attributes. The algorithms for data pre-processing and modeling by optimizing parameters are suggested. Three strategies were tested: (1) with all available variables, (2) with a filter-based variable selection, and (3) with a wrapper-based variable selection which integrates Boruta algorithm and random forest. Prediction models of energy cost are created using two approaches: (a) comparative usage of artificial neural networks and two types of regression trees, CART and random forest, and (b) integration of RF-Boruta variable selection and machine learning methods for prediction. A cross-validation procedure was used to optimize the artificial neural network and regression tree topology, as well to select the most appropriate activation function. Along with creating a prediction model, the aim of the paper was also to extract the relevant predictors of energy cost in public buildings which are important in planning the construction or renovation of buildings. The results have shown that the second approach which integrates machine learning with Boruta method, where the random forest algorithm is used for both variable reduction and prediction modeling, has produced a higher accuracy of prediction than the individual usage of three machine learning methods. Such findings confirm the potential of hybrid machine learning methods which are suggested in previous research, but in favor of random forest method over CART and artificial neural networks. Regarding the variable selection, the model has extracted heating and occupational data as the most important, followed by constructional, cooling, electricity, and lighting attributes. The model could be implemented in public buildings information systems and their IoT networks within the concept of smart buildings and smart cities. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Funding text 1: The authors are grateful to the Agency for Legal Trade and Real Estate Brokerage (APN) of the Republic of Croatia for providing the data used in this paper from the Croatian energy management information system – EMIS.

Urban morphological feature extraction and similarity analysis represents a practical framework in many studies to interpret and introduce the current built environment to aid in proposing novel designs. In conventional methods, morphological features are represented based on qualitative descriptions, symbolical interpretation, or manually selected indicators. However, these methods could cause subjective bias and limit the generalizability. This study proposes a hybrid data-driven approach to support quantitative morphological descriptions and multi-dimensional similarity analysis for urban design decision-making and to further morphology-related studies using information abundance via a deep-learning approach. We constructed a dataset of 3817 residential plots with geometrical and related infrastructure information. A deep convolutional neural network, GoogLeNet, was implemented with the plots’ figure–ground images, by quantifying the morphological features into 2048-dimensional feature vectors. We conducted a similarity analysis of the plots by calculating the Euclidean distance between the high-dimensional feature vectors. Then, a comparison study was performed by retrieving cases based on the plot shape and plots with buildings separately. The proposed method considers the overall characteristics of the urban morphology and social infrastructure situations for similarity analysis. This method is flexible and effective. The proposed framework indicates the feasibility and potential of integrating task-oriented information to introduce custom and adequate references via deep learning methods, which could support decision making and association studies on morphology with urban consequences. This work could serve as a basis for further typo-morphology studies and other morphology-related ecological, social, and economic studies for sustainable built environments. © 2021 by the authors.

Water is a basic physiological need, and smart management of water plays a significant role in a smart city. This paper focuses on a mathematical model and IoT framework that aid in developing a smart city. A framework is developed for water supply management. The efficiency of the water supply can be measured by monitoring leakage conditions, overflow of water, automatic meter reading and online bill payments, and water consumption status of households, community, state, and eventually the whole country as well as the automatic water supply line cut-off. The system where the IoT is being deployed consists of embedded hardware in which sensors and microcontrollers provide messages and gain feedback from each other with the help of the in-ternet, and this process can not only be monitored but also can be controlled from a remote location. The developed framework addresses all these aspects and mathematical equations are used and formulated while developing the IoT application. The mathematical equations are concentrated on consumption level (CL), leakage reporting (LR), and bill amount (BA) based on consumption. These become the point of contact for deploying IoT and eventually a framework is developed. This framework can be useful not only in water supply management but also in the management of road traf-fic, pollution, garbage, home automation and so on. In a nutshell, this paper illustrates the usage of the IoT framework in water supply management which contributes to developing the smart city. © 2021 by the authors.

However, no study has focused on the spatiotemporal analysis of its land use/land cover. The present research aims at providing a comprehensive analysis of land use/land cover change in the Luki Biosphere Reserve from the year 1987 to 2020, and to predict its future change for the year 2038. Landsat images were classified in order to provide land use/land cover maps for the years 1987, 2002, 2017 and 2020. Based on these maps, change detection, gradient direction, and landscape metric analyses were performed. In addition, land use/land cover change prediction was carried out using the Multilayer Perceptron Markov model. The results revealed significant land use/land cover changes in the Luki Biosphere Reserve during the study period. Indeed, tremendous changes in the primary forest, which lost around 17.8% of its total area, were noted. Other classes, notably savannah, secondary forest, built-up area, fallow land and fields had gained 79.35, 1150.36, 67.63, 3852.12 hectares, respectively. Based on the landscape metric analysis, it was revealed that built-up areas and fallow land and fields experienced an aggregation trend, while other classes showed disaggregation and fragmentation trends. Analysis further revealed that village expansion has significantly affected the process of land use/land cover change in the Luki Biosphere Reserve. However, the prediction results revealed that the primary forest will continue to increase while built-up area, fallow land and fields will follow a trend similar to a previous one. As for secondary forest and savannah, the forecast revealed a decrease of the extent during the period extending from 2020 to 2038. The present findings will benefit the decision makers, particularly in the sustainable natural resources management of the Luki Biosphere Reserve. © 2021 by the authors.

Widely used European land cover maps such as CORINE (Coordination of Information on the Environment) are produced at medium spatial resolutions (100 m) and rely on diverse data with complex workflows requiring significant institutional capacity. We present a 10 m resolution land cover map (ELC10) of Europe based on a satellite-driven machine learning work-flow that is annually updatable. A random forest classification model was trained on 70K ground-truth points from the LUCAS (Land Use/Cover Area Frame Survey) dataset. Within the Google Earth Engine cloud computing environment, the ELC10 map can be generated from approx. 700 TB of Sentinel imagery within approx. 4 days from a single research user account. The map achieved an overall accuracy of 90% across eight land cover classes and could account for statistical unit land cover proportions within 3.9% (R2 = 0.83) of the actual value. These accuracies are higher than that of CORINE (100 m) and other 10 m land cover maps including S2GLC and FROM-GLC10. Spectro-temporal metrics that capture the phenology of land cover classes were most important in produc-ing high mapping accuracies. We found that the atmospheric correction of Sentinel-2 and the speckle filtering of Sentinel-1 imagery had a minimal effect on enhancing the classification accuracy (< 1%). However, combining optical and radar imagery increased accuracy by 3% compared to Sen-tinel-2 alone and by 10% compared to Sentinel-1 alone. The addition of auxiliary data (terrain, climate and night-time lights) increased accuracy by an additional 2%. By using the centroid pixels from the LUCAS Copernicus module polygons we increased accuracy by <1%, revealing that random forests are robust against contaminated training data. Furthermore, the model requires very little training data to achieve moderate accuracies—the difference between 5K and 50K LUCAS points is only 3% (86 vs. 89%). This implies that significantly less resources are necessary for making in situ survey data (such as LUCAS) suitable for satellite-based land cover classification. At 10 m resolution, the ELC10 map can distinguish detailed landscape features like hedgerows and gardens, and therefore holds potential for aerial statistics at the city borough level and monitoring property-level environmental interventions (e.g., tree planting). Due to the reliance on purely satellite-based input data, the ELC10 map can be continuously updated independent of any country-specific geo-graphic datasets. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper presents a chronology of factors on the development of smart cities, including IoT technologies as network infrastructure. Increasing IoT nodes leads to increasing data flow, which is a potential source of failure for IoT networks. The biggest challenge of IoT networks is that the IoT may have insufficient memory to handle all transaction data within the IoT network. We aim in this paper to propose a potential compression method for reducing IoT network data traffic. Therefore, we investigate various lossless compression algorithms, such as entropy or dictionary-based algorithms, and general compression methods to determine which algorithm or method adheres to the IoT specifications. Furthermore, this study conducts compression experiments using entropy (Huffman, Adaptive Huffman) and Dictionary (LZ77, LZ78) as well as five different types of datasets of the IoT data traffic. Though the above algorithms can alleviate the IoT data traffic, adaptive Huffman gave the best compression algorithm. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to propose a conceptual compression method for IoT data traffic by improving an adaptive Huffman based on deep learning concepts using weights, pruning, and pooling in the neural net-work. The proposed algorithm is believed to obtain a better compression ratio. Additionally, in this paper, we also discuss the challenges of applying the proposed algorithm to IoT data compression due to the limitations of IoT memory and IoT processor, which later it can be implemented in IoT networks. © 2021 by the authors.

The proposed framework combines mobility of UAV with IoT measurements and full-stack WebRTC communications. WebRTC offers simultaneous transmission of both a real-time video stream and the flow of data coming from sensors, and ensures a kind of protection of data flow, which leads to preserving its near-real-time character and enables contextual communication. Addition of the AI accelerator hardware makes this system AI-ready, i.e., the IoT communication hub, which is the air component of our system, is able to perform tasks of AI-supported computing. The exemplary prototype of this system was evaluated in terms of the ability to work with fast-response sensors, the ability to work with high temporal and high spatial resolutions, video information in poor visibility conditions and AI-readiness.

Recognizing the importance of filtering false information for the smart city population, this research proposed a policy and platform for filtering false information to be presented to the citizens of Sisaket Smart City, Thailand; this was to ensure the efficient and secure use of large amounts of citizens' information, as well as information exchange between agencies. Additionally, the study was designed to kick-start the use of information in a smart city to make it more efficient and capable of filtering out material that could have harmful consequences or fake news. Recognizing its significance, the researchers proposed building regulations and platforms for detecting and filtering fake news in smart cities using artificial intelligence and blockchain technology.

Current approaches for building visual object detection models require large and well-labeled dataset stored by a centralized entity.

Federated learning (FL) is a promising machine learning paradigm to address these challenges. In this paper, we report on FedVision—a machine learning engineering platform to support the development of federated learning powered computer vision applications—to bridge this important gap. The platform has been deployed through collaboration between WeBank and Extreme Vision to help customers develop computer vision-based safety monitoring solutions in smart city applications. Through actual usage, it has demonstrated significant efficiency improvement and cost reduction while fulfilling privacy-preservation requirements (e.g., reducing communication overhead for one company by 50 fold and saving close to 40,000RMB of network cost per annum).

Sharing and reuse of these elaborated resources between intelligent systems of different environments, which is known as transfer learning, would facilitate the adoption of cognitive services for the users and accelerate the uptake of intelligent systems in smart building and smart city applications. Currently, machine learning processes are commonly built for intra-organization purposes and tailored towards specific use cases with the assumption of integrated model repositories and feature pools. Transferring such services and models beyond organization boundaries is a challenging task that requires human intervention to find the matching models and evaluate them. This paper investigates the potential of communication and transfer learning between smart environments in order to empower a decentralized and peer-to-peer ecosystem for seamless and automatic transfer of services and machine learning models.

This paper describes AI perspectives in SCC and gives an overview of AI-based technologies used in traffic to enable road vehicle automation and smart traffic control. Perception, smart traffic control and driver modeling are described along with open research challenges and standardization to help introduce advanced driver assistance systems and automated vehicle functionality in traffic. To fully realize the potential of SCC, to create a holistic view on a city level, availability of data from different stakeholders is necessary. Further, though AI technologies provide accurate predictions and classifications, there is an ambiguity regarding the correctness of their outputs. This can make it difficult for the human operator to trust the system. Today there are no methods that can be used to match function requirements with the level of detail in data annotation in order to train an accurate model. Another challenge related to trust is explainability: models can have difficulty explaining how they came to certain conclusions, so it is difficult for humans to trust them. © 2021 by the authors.

The vision of the program is to accelerate the transition towards inclusive, climate neutral cities until 2030 with a good life for all with the help of digitalization and citizen engagement. Viable Cities is like its siblings Drive Sweden and InfraSweden2030 financed by Vinnova, the Swedish Energy Agency, and Formas. Within the Viable Cities program, a strategic initiative, the Viable Cities Transition Lab was formed to foster capabilities to handle the societal challenges within climate and environmental transitions. The Transition Lab aims at luring the full potential out of humans in the era of digitalization and automation, and thus obtaining new methods to transform society for an equal and circular economy, and responsible and ground-breaking technology to create behavioral changes toward a more sustainable and entrepreneurial society. Xplorion—a residential mobility service in car-free accommodation is a project financed by Viable Cities [33]. It offers a mix of mobility services such as public transport, carpooling, and bicycle pooling to households in a new residential area called Södra Brunnshög in Lund Sweden. The aim is to provide mobility as part of the residential rent, and thus allow more efficient use of transport leading to a reduction in emissions from residents’ travel. It is also expected that by connecting housing and mobility, there will be synergies that will make the resources in the system more efficient than today.; Funding text 2: In Sweden where this research is carried out, there are a number of initiatives from the Swedish government to support the development of SCC.

Drive Sweden is financed by the Swedish Innovation Agency, Vinnova, the Swedish Energy Agency, and the Swedish research council for sustainable development, Formas. Drive Sweden also provides a weekly newsletter that summarizes news within the area of smart mobility [30]. Examples of projects that has been financed by Drive Sweden, within the field of future mobility, are, for example: Study of communication needs in interaction between trucks and surrounding traffic in platooning, Intelligent and self-learning traffic control with 3D and AI and Security for autonomous vehicles from a societal and safety perspective .; Funding text 3: CIVITAS [28] is a pan European network of cities that are dedicated to cleaner and better transports. The network is financed by the European Commission and was launched in 2002. Since then, 85 cities have joined the network and more than 900 measures and urban transport solutions have been tested and implemented. The main goal of CIVITAS is to make it easier for cities to obtain cleaner and better connected transport solutions in Europe and beyond. The four main characteristics of CIVITAS are a living laboratory approach to bring out research projects, maintaining a network of cities for cities, facilitating a public– private partnerships, and promoting political commitment. The network gives unique opportunities for practitioners to experience innovative transport solutions and learn from experts in the field. Sustainable mobility is the overall area and the project is divided into 10 sub areas: car-independent lifestyles; clean fuels and vehicles; collective passenger transport; demand management strategies; integrated planning; mobility management; public involvement; safety and security; transport telematics; urban freight logistics.; Funding text 4: The EU project CITYKeys is funded by the European Union HORIZON 2020 program. In collaboration with cities, the project has developed and validated key performance indicators along with data collection procedures for common and transparent monitoring to be able to compare smart city solutions across European cities [27]. The project has divided the smart city into sub-themes that concern, e.g., diversity and social cohesion, and aim at promoting diversity, community engagement, and social cohesion within a community. Education focuses on improving the accessibility and quality of education for everyone. Safety concerns lowering the rates of crime and accidents. Health focuses on improving the quality and accessibility of public health systems, for everyone, and encouraging a healthy lifestyle. Quality of housing and the built environment promote development of mixed-income areas, ensure high quality and quantity of public spaces and recreational areas, and improve affordability and accessibility to good housing for everyone. Finally, quality of life also promotes access to (other) services that focus on providing better access to amenities and affordable services in physical and virtual spaces for everyone.

A data-driven approach is considered, using artificial intelligence and methods to minimize cascading effects and the destruction of failing critical infrastructures and their components (at a city level). The proposed approach allows rapid recovery of infrastructures’ service performance levels after disasters while keeping the coverage of the assessment of risks, prevention, detection, response, and mitigation of consequences. The proposed approach has the originality and the practical implication of providing a decision support system that handles the infrastructures that will support the city disaster management system—make the city prepare, adapt, absorb, respond, and recover from disasters by taking advantage of the interconnections between its various critical infrastructures to increase the overall resilience capacity.

Based on data accumulation in modern society, more and more data-driven methods are proposed. However, it is still not easy to process the raw data to an interpretable level in practical applications. In this article, the GPS data are obtained from floating cars covering a large scale region in Xi'an, China. To link the original data to the spatiotemporal relationship of driving behaviour, a pre-processing method with specified time–frequency rules is proposed. Through map matching and landmark mapping, it can be seen that the data dispersion degree has decreased and the quality of the original data has been improved. At the same time, deep learning methods and non-parametric survival analysis methods are used to compare and evaluate traffic congestion. In addition, four different distributions (Exponential, Weibull, Log-normal, and Log-logistic) are tested to fit the accelerated failure time model (AFT), which is then compared with the Cox proportional hazards model (Cox). It is concluded that the most suitable parameter model for the test section of Xi'an South Second Ring Road is AFT (Lognormal). All those methods are tested on a randomly selected segment on the ring road in Xi'an. The results suggest dramatic improvement of data quality and successful evaluation of traffic conditions with high reliability. Potential application could be effective methods for traffic control and management in the smart city. © 2021 The Authors.

Bus micro-environmental pollution and its adverse impacts on passengers' physical and psychological well-being has become an increasing concern among the general public, researchers, and policymakers. However, few studies have examined the nonlinear effects of bus micro- environments on passengers' comfort, analyzed the threshold values of multiple microenvironmental variables, and ascertained the optimal micro-environmental exposure levels for passengers. In this study, real-time monitoring data of bus micro-environments, questionnaire survey data of 520 passengers, travel characteristics, and environments outside the buses were simultaneously collected on six bus routes in Guangzhou City. Nonlinear regression models constructed by random forest were then employed to explore the relationships between bus micro- environments and passengers' comfort. The results show that in- bus temperature, relative humidity, PM2.5 concentrations, noise, and passenger load have nonlinear effects on the comfort, but the importance and mechanism of each micro- environmental variable in influencing comfort is different. Passengers have a higher degree of comfort when in- bus temperature is 23.5- 28.0 ℃, relative humidity is 45%-58%, PM2.5 concentrations are lower than 28 μg/m³, noise level is lower than 75 dB, and passenger load is 8- 26 persons. Also, there are some differences between the optimal micro- environmental exposure levels identified in this study and current environmental standards. These findings have theoretical and practical implications for policymakers, transportation planners, and bus operators when improving bus microenvironments and promoting passengers' comfort. © 2021, Editorial office of PROGRESS IN GEOGRAPHY.

This increased flexibility is required due to the growing proportion of intermittent renewable energy generation into the energy mix, and increasing complexity in demand profiles from the electrification of transport networks. Currently, less than 2% of the global potential for demand-side flexibility is currently utilised, but a more widespread adoption of residential consumers as flexibility resources can lead to substantially higher utilisation of the demand-side flexibility potential. In order to achieve this target, acquiring a better understanding of how residential DR participants respond in DR events is essential – and recent advances in novel machine learning and statistical AI provide promising tools to address this challenge. This study provides an in-depth analysis of how residential customers have responded in incentive-based DR, utilising household-related data from a large-scale, real-world trial: the Smart Grid, Smart City (SGSC) project. Using a number of different machine learning approaches, we model the relationship between a household's response and household-related features. Moreover, we examine the potential effects of households’ features on the residential response behaviour, and highlight a number of key insights which raise questions about the reported level of consumers’ engagement in DR schemes, and the motivation for different customers’ response level. Finally, we explore the temporal structure of the response – and although we found no supporting evidence of DR responders learning over time for the available data from this trial, the proposed methodologies could be used for longer-term longitudinal DR studies. Our study concludes with a broader discussion of our findings and potential paths for future research in this emerging area. © 2021 The Author(s)",The authors would like to acknowledge the support of the Energy Technology Partnership Scotland (ETP) through their Industry Doctorates scheme and our industrial sponsor Upside Energy.

One of the major research focuses of 6G is to enable massive Internet of Things (mIoT) applications. Like Wi-Fi 6 (IEEE 802.11ax), forthcoming wireless communication networks are likely to meet massively deployed devices and extremely new smart applications such as smart cities for mIoT. However, channel scarcity is still present due to a massive number of connected devices accessing the common spectrum resources. With this expectation, next-generation Wi-Fi 6 and beyond for mIoT are anticipated to have inherent machine intelligence capabilities to access the optimum channel resources for their performance optimization. Unfortunately, current wireless communication network standards do not support the ensuing needs of machine learning (ML)-aware frameworks in terms of resource allocation optimization. Keeping such an issue in mind, we propose a reinforcement-learning-based, one of the ML techniques, a framework for a wireless channel access mechanism for IEEE 802.11 standards (i.e., Wi-Fi) in mIoT. The proposed mechanism suggests exploiting a practically measured channel collision probability as a collected dataset from the wireless environment to select optimal resource allocation in mIoT for upcoming 6G wireless communications. © 2017 IEEE.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112511429,Yes,South Korea,Infrastructure,Smart City Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Reinforcement Learning,Optimization,Enable massive IoT for 6G wireless communications using reinforcement learning,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Review/Survey,Qualitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

The smart reconstruction of the heating system in old communities is now an inevitable choice for urban development. However, there is not yet any unified risk assessment system for these smart heating reconstruction projects. By virtue of the advantages of artificial neural network (ANN) in data processing, this paper tries to assess the risks of smart community heating reconstruction projects. Firstly, a risk assessment system was established for smart community heating reconstruction projects, and the sensitivity of the indices was analyzed. Next, the primary and secondary models for risk assessment were constructed, and the reliability of project investment risk assessment was examined. Finally, artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) was adopted to optimize the initial connection weights and thresholds of backpropagation neural network (BPNN), and the AFSA-optimized network was adopted to build a risk assessment model for smart community heating reconstruction projects. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model were verified through experiments. © 2021 International Information and Engineering Technology Association.

Therefore, precise modeling techniques are necessary to predict air quality in congested areas such as megacities. Recently, machine learning algorithms such as Neural Networks show significant possibilities in air quality studies. This paper proposes a model to estimate air quality in a congested urban area in Baghdad city using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm and Geospatial Information System (GIS) techniques. Carbon Monoxide (CO) gas is selected as the main air pollutant. The model parameters involve; CO samples, traffic flow, weather data, and land use information collected in the field. The proposed model is implemented in Matlab environment and the results are processed after entering ArcGIS software. Using its spatial analysis tools, the outputs are presented as a map. The final findings indicate the highest value of CO emissions that reached 34 ppm during the daytime. The most polluted areas are located near congested roads and industrial locations in comparison with residential areas. The proposed model is validated by using actual values that are collected from the field, where the model's accuracy is 79%. The proposed model showed feasibility and applicability in a congested urban area due to the integration between the machine learning algorithm and GIS modeling. Therefore, the proposed model in this research can be used as a supportive model for decision making of city managers. © University of Tehran",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85111517100,Yes,Iran,Environment,Environment & Sustainability,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,"ANN, GIS",Prediction/Forecasting,Model and predict CO emissions using ANN and GIS in Baghdad city,"SDG 3 (Health), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 13 (Climate)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

The utilisation of big data is required if equitable and efficient transportation networks are to be realised for smart, interconnected cities of the future. The rapid and widespread adoption of digital twins, IoT (Internet of Things), artificial intelligence and mini edge computing technologies serve as the catalyst to rapidly develop and deploy smart systems for real-time data acquisition of traffic in and around urban and metropolitan areas. This paper presents a proof of concept of a mini edge computing platform for real-time edge processing, which serves as a digital twin of a multi-lane freeway located in Pretoria, South Africa. Video data acquired from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is processed using a neural network architecture designed for real-time object detection tracking of vehicles. The implementation successfully counted vehicles (cars and trucks) together with an estimation of the speed of each detected vehicle. These results compare favourably to the ground truth data with vehicle counting accuracies of 5% realised. Detection of sparse motorcycles and pedestrians were less than optimal. This proof of concept can be easily scaled and deployed over a wide geographic area. Integration of these cyber-physical assets can be incorporated into existing video monitoring systems or fused with optical sensors as a single data acquisition system. © 2021",4Tel Pty is gratefully acknowledged for sponsoring the Chair in Railway Engineering in the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Pretoria.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85111397458,Yes,South Africa,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,Deep Learning (Edge AI),Classification,Develop real-time traffic quantization using mini edge AI platform,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Medium

Wi-Fi device-free sensing technology has received more and more attention in recent years. Counting the people in queuing is an uneasy task due to labile information. Most current counting schemes have existed in an ideal environment with idealistic people's behavior. In this article, we propose a more realistic counting scheme called Que-Fi, a queue number identification system based on Wi-Fi channel state information and a deep learning network. In the proposed Que-Fi scheme, the nonnegligible interference of human motion and the surrounding environment is first analyzed based on the Fresnel zone. Then, we proposed a static model based on the convolutional long short-term memory fully connected deep neural network in order to overcome the interference. A dynamic Que-Fi model is proposed to identify the entering/leaving people's behavior and update the counting number. In this article, different preprocessing methods are analyzed and compared to test and evaluate the proposed Que-Fi. Experiments have shown that the proposed Que-Fi outperforms the traditional support vector machine and provide accuracy up to 95% and 96.67% for static and dynamic models, respectively. © 2007-2012 IEEE.","Manuscript received January 28, 2020; revised April 17, 2020; accepted May 5, 2020.

R.Rene, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Sri Sairam Engineering College, Chennai, Chennai, TN, India","Today, smart cities are being built with the wide deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT). Smart cities (SCs) set out in real time to ameliorate the quality of human life in respect of efficiency and comfort. Security along with privacy are the main issues in most SCs. The IoT-centric frameworks impose certain security threats on smart city applications as they are susceptible to security issues. On this account, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is requisite for mitigating the IoT-associated security attacks which take advantage of certain security vulnerabilities. The aim of this paper is to improve the security and attack detection rate as early as possible. In existing works, the accuracy of the attack detection rate and security are the main challenge. To overcome any drawbacks, this work proposes an IDS for detecting the IoT attacks in a city centered on the DLMNN classification. First, the sensor values from a SC are sent to the IDS system (the training phase), which is utilized for testing the respective values. Next, the preprocessing step is performed, and then feature selection (FS) is carried out with the utilization of the Entropy-HOA method. Further on, the classification using DLMNN is performed for detecting the IoT attacks. Then, the results of the classification are analyzed and the attack is identified. Next, a secure data sharing task is performed by using the KH-AES algorithm. Last, the resulting data is forecast. The weights for each layer of the DLMNN have a high impact on the classifier's output. The comparison of the existing technique and of the proposed technique with regard to FS, classification and secure data sharing reveals that the proposed technique obtained the best results. © 2021.

Existing solutions for the clutter versus multi-source radar classification task are limited in terms of either accuracy or efficiency, and in some cases, struggle with a tradeoff between false alarms and recall of sources. We find that this problem can be resolved by learning the classifier across multiple time-scales. We propose a multi-scale, cascaded recurrent neural network architecture, MSC-RNN, composed of an efficient multi-instance learning (MIL) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for clutter discrimination at a lower tier and a more complex RNN classifier for source classification at the upper tier. By controlling the invocation of the upper RNN with the help of the lower tier conditionally, MSC-RNN achieves an overall accuracy of 0.972. Our approach holistically improves the accuracy and per-class recalls over machine learning models suitable for radar inferencing. Notably, we outperform cross-domain handcrafted feature engineering with purely time-domain deep feature learning, while also being up to ĝ1/43× more efficient than a competitive solution. © 2021 ACM.","This submission is a journal extension of the ACM BuildSys 2019 publications [35, 38] by the same authors.

Simultaneously, urban resilience is very indispensable for future urban land use planning and management. Therefore, consistent urban proliferation can be coped through Prediction-Adaptation-Resilience (PAR), to accomplish future urban land use and sustainable development of any growing up urban areas worldwide. Therefore, different dynamic simulation models, e.g. Cellular automata-Markov model, artificial neural network, are used to project and predict any urban areas' spatial growth. Then, the adaptation strategies are taken to assess the urban land use transformation in the past and present context. Those strategies help to strengthen urban land use planning using an integrated supply and demand chain. Finally, this study checks the resilience of how much it will be threatened or saved for future sustainable urban developmental goals and urban resilience. Therefore, it is important to establish a conceptual framework to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) based on principles of the PAR approach. Advocating the on-going adaptation of sustainability, resilience, and rapid urban transformation in the developing cities requires clear and explicit definitions that are embedded with the recent and particular context. Thus, government and policy makers should draw their attention to make proper urban landscape planning and adaptation strategies for the future urban expansion in a holistic way by maintaining appropriate urban resilience. © 2021",I would like to thank Dr. Malay K.

Second, we draw upon survey data stored in IPUMS (Integrated Public Use Microdata Series) to include extensive, harmonized, and disaggregated data. Third, we use open source software and share our scripts to ensure transparency and replicability. DUIA includes information on dwelling and household characteristics, educational attainment, ownership of assets and appliances, and access to amenities.

These operations have increased due to the growth of electronic commerce and direct-to-consumer strategies. We propose a novel data-and model-driven framework to support decision making for urban distribution. The methodology is composed of diverse, hybrid, and complementary techniques integrated by a decision support system. This approach focuses on key elements of megacities such as socio-demographic diversity, portfolio mix, logistics fragmentation, high congestion factors, and dense commercial areas. The methodological framework will allow decision makers to create early warning systems and, with the implementation of optimization, machine learning, and simulation models together, make the best utilization of resources. The advantages of the system include flexibility in decision making, social welfare, increased productivity, and reductions in cost and environmental impacts. A real-world illustrative example is presented under conditions in one of the most congested cities: the megacity of Bogota, Colombia. Data come from a retail organization operating in the city. A network of stakeholders is analyzed to understand the complex urban distribution. The execution of the methodology was capable of solving a complex problem reducing the number of vehicles utilized, increasing the resource capacity utilization, and reducing the cost of operations of the fleet, meeting all constraints. These constraints included the window of operations and accomplishing the total number of deliveries. Furthermore, the methodology could accomplish the learning function using deep reinforcement learning in reasonable computational times. This preliminary analysis shows the potential benefits, especially in understudied metropolitan areas from emerging markets, supporting a more effective delivery process, and encouraging proactive, dynamic decision making during the execution stage. © 2021 by the authors.

A city’s walkability and walkability index have become current research hotspots. Based on prior research on walkability and related urban policies, this study selects Coomera Town on the Gold Coast of Queensland, Australia, as the research area because of Coomera Town policy regulations and environmental requirements. This study utilizes traditional qualitative and quantitative research methods, machine mining technology, and the deep learning big data analysis technology to conduct thematic design research in a real place. Its combines walkability evaluation with walkability design to construct a walkable city in a targeted manner. This provides a reference for related city design in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

However, due to the complex landscapes and highdensity settlements, automatically characterizing building in the urban village or cities using remote sensing images is very challenging. Inspired by the rencent deep learning methods, this paper proposed a novel end-to-end building segmentation network for segmenting buildings from remote sensing images. The network includes two branches: one branch uses Widely Adaptive Spatial Pyramid (WASP) structure to extract multi-scale features, and the other branch uses a deep residual network combined with a sub-pixel up-sampling structure to enhance the detail of building boundaries. We compared our proposed method with three state-of-the-art networks: DeepLabv3+, ENet, ESPNet. Experiments were performed using the publicly available Inria Aerial Image Labelling dataset (Inria aerial dataset) and the Satellite dataset II(East Asia). The results showed that our method outperformed the other networks in the experiments, with Pixel Accuracy reaching 0.8421 and 0.8738, respectively and with mIoU reaching 0.9034 and 0.8936 respectively. Compared with the basic network, it has increased by about 25% or more. It can not only extract building footprints, but also especially small building objects. © 2021 by the authors.

The changing characteristics of land use will affect and challenge how a city is able to manage, organize, and plan for new developments and transportation. These challenges can be better addressed with effective methods of monitoring and predicting, which can enable optimal efficiency in how a growing city like Calgary, Canada, can perform. Using ontology in land use planning is a new initiative currently being researched and explored. In this regard, ontology incorporates relationships between the various entities of land use. The aim of this study is to present Land Use Change Ontology (LUCO) with a deep neural network for traffic prediction. We present a Land Use Change Ontology (LUCO) approach, using expressions of how the semantics of land use changes relate to the integration of temporal land use information. This study examines the City of Calgary’s land use data from the years 2001, 2010, and 2015. In applying the LUCO approach to test data, experimental outcomes indicated that from 2001 to 2015 residential land use increased by 30% and open space decreased by 40%. Forecasting traffic is increasingly essential for successful traffic modelling, operations, and management. However, traditional means for predicting traffic flow have largely assumed restrictive model architectures that have not controlled for the amounts of land use change. Inspired by deep learning methods and effective data mining computing capabilities, this paper introduces the deep learning Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict traffic while considering the impact of land use change. The RNN was successful in learning the features of traffic flow under various land use change situations. Experimental results indicated that, with the consideration of LUCO, the deep learning predictors had better accuracy when compared with other existing models. Success of our modeling approach indicates that cities could apply this modeling approach to make land use transportation planning more efficient. © 2021 by the authors.

J., Institute of Management of Technology, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan","Regional population forecast and analysis is of essence to urban and regional planning, and a well-designed plan can effectively construct a sound national infrastructure and stabilize positive population growth. Traditionally, either urban or regional planning relies on the opinions of demographers in terms of how the population of a city or a region will grow. Multi-regional population forecast is currently possible, carried out mainly on the basis of the Interregional Cohort-Component model. While this model has its unique advantages, several demographic rates are determined based on the decisions made by primary planners. Hence, the only drawback for cohort-component type population forecasting is allowing the analyst to specify the demographic rates of the future, and it goes without saying that this tends to introduce a biased result in forecasting accuracy. To effectively avoid this problem, this work proposes a machine learning-based method to forecast multi-regional population growth objectively. Thus, this work, drawing upon the newly developed machine learning technology, attempts to analyze and forecast the population growth of major cities in Taiwan. By effectively using the advantage of the XGBoost algorithm, the evaluation of feature importance and the forecast of multi-regional population growth between the present and the near future can be observed objectively, and it can further provide an objective reference to the urban planning of regional population. © 2021 by the authors.

These trajectory data are of great significance which can be used to extract relevant information in order to, for instance, calculate the optimal path from one position to another, detect abnormal behavior, monitor the traffic flow in a city, and predict the next position of an object. One of the key technology is to cluster vehicle trajectory. However, existing methods mainly rely on manually designed metrics which may lead to biased results. Meanwhile, the large scale of vehicle trajectory data has become a challenge because calculating these manually designed metrics will cost more time and space. To address these challenges, we propose to employ network representation learning to achieve accurate vehicle trajectory clustering. Specifically, we first construct the k-nearest neighbor-based internet of vehicles in a dynamic manner. Then we learn the low-dimensional representations of vehicles by performing dynamic network representation learning on the constructed network. Finally, using the learned vehicle vectors, vehicle trajectories are clustered with machine learning methods. Experimental results on the real-word dataset show that our method achieves the best performance compared against baseline methods. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Manuscript received January 26, 2020; revised March 28, 2020; accepted April 21, 2020.

Due to the constant environmental, social, and economic transformations of cities, UGSs pose new challenges for management, particularly in fast-growing metropolitan areas. With technological advancement and the evolution of deep learning, it is possible to optimize the acquisition of UGS inventories through the detection of geometric patterns present in satellite imagery. This research evaluates two deep learning model techniques for semantic segmentation of UGS polygons with the use of different convolutional neural network encoders on the U-Net architecture and very high resolution (VHR) imagery to obtain updated information on UGS polygons at the metropolitan area level. The best model yielded a Dice coefficient of 0.57, IoU of 0.75, recall of 0.80, and kappa coefficient of 0.94 with an overall accuracy of 0.97, which reflects a reliable performance of the network in detecting patterns that make up the varied geometry of UGSs. A complete database of UGS polygons was quantified and categorized by types with location and delimited by municipality, allowing for the standardization of the information at the metropolitan level, which will be useful for comparative analysis with a homogenized and updated database.

Indeed, building sensing data provides a promising way to enrich a series of data-demanding and cost-expensive urban mobile applications. In this paper, as a preliminary exploration, we study how to reuse building sensing data to predict traffic volume on nearby roads. Compared with existing studies, reusing building sensing data has considerable merits of cost-efficiency and high-reliability. Nevertheless, it is non-trivial to achieve accurate prediction on such cross-domain data with two major challenges. First, relationships between building sensing data and traffic data are not unknown as prior, and the spatio-temporal complexities impose more difficulties to uncover the underlying reasons behind the above relationships. Second, it is even more daunting to accurately predict traffic volume with dynamic building-traffic correlations, which are cross-domain, non-linear, and time-varying. To address the above challenges, we design and implement BuildSenSys, a first-of-its-kind system for nearby traffic volume prediction by reusing building sensing data. Our work consists of two parts, i.e., Correlation Analysis and Cross-domain Learning. First, we conduct a comprehensive building-traffic analysis based on multi-source datasets, disclosing how and why building sensing data is correlated with nearby traffic volume. Second, we propose a novel recurrent neural network for traffic volume prediction based on cross-domain learning with two attention mechanisms. Specifically, a cross-domain attention mechanism captures the building-traffic correlations and adaptively extracts the most relevant building sensing data at each predicting step. Then, a temporal attention mechanism is employed to model the temporal dependencies of data across historical time intervals. The extensive experimental studies demonstrate that BuildSenSys outperforms all baseline methods with up to 65.3 percent accuracy improvement (e.g., 2.2 percent MAPE) in predicting nearby traffic volume. We believe that this work can open a new gate of reusing building sensing data for urban traffic sensing, thus establishing connections between smart buildings and intelligent transportation. © 2020 IEEE.","The authors would like to thank Zhao Zhang, Xiang Huang, Qingqing Wang, Xiaopu Zhang and Xianghao Chu for their support and assistance with this work.

Among these time scales, estimation of next-day SUHIs is of special significance to urban residents, yet we currently lack a simple but efficient approach for making such estimations. In the present study, we propose a statistical strategy for estimating next-day nighttime SUHIs, based on incorporating various SUHI controls into a support vector machine regression (SVR) model. The majority of both the surface controls (including factors related to land cover and solar radiation) and meteorological controls (including temperature fluctuations, relative humidity, accumulated precipitation, wind speed, aerosol optical depth, and soil moisture) that have previously been found to account for daily SUHI variations were used as estimators, and we provide estimations for both the overall SUHI intensity (SUHII) and pixel-by-pixel Gaussian-based LSTs over 59 Chinese megacities. For the overall SUHII, the mean absolute error (MAE) is 0.67 K on average, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is no more than 25% for more than 90% of the cities. For the pixel-by-pixel LSTs, the associated MAE is less than 2.0 K in most scenarios. In addition, the contribution from each selected estimator to SUHII estimation is assessed comprehensively. Among all the estimators, the contribution from relative humidity is the greatest, followed by rural surface temperature and surface air temperature. Moreover, for nearly 78% of the cities, the estimators related to day-to-day SUHI variations make a larger contribution than those related to intra-annual SUHI variations. We conclude that our simple yet effective statistical approach for estimating next-day SUHIs can potentially help urban residents to better adapt to urban heat stress. © 2021 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Safeguarding heritage is also valued highly in the priorities of the European Commission. As a result, there have been several long-term initiatives involving the digitisation, annotation and cataloguing of tangible cultural heritage in museums and collections. Specifically, for built heritage, a pressing challenge is that historical monuments such as buildings, temples, churches or city fortification infrastructures are hard to document due to their historic palimpsest; spatial transformations, actions of destruction, reuse of material, or continuous urban development that covers traces and changes the formal integrity and identity of a cultural heritage site. The ability to reason about a monument's form is crucial for efficient documentation and cataloguing. This paper presents a 3D digitisation workflow through the involvement of reality capture technologies for the annotation and structure analysis of built heritage with the use of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs) for classification purposes. The presented workflow contributes a new approach to the identification of a building's architectural components (e.g., arch, dome) and to the study of the stylistic influences (e.g., Gothic, Byzantine) of building parts. In doing so this workflow can assist in tracking a building's history, identifying its construction period and comparing it to other buildings of the same period. This process can contribute to educational and research activities, as well as facilitate the automated classification of datasets in digital repositories for scholarly research in digital humanities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Funding text 1: This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 739578 and under grant agreement No EXCELLENCE/1216/0352 and the Government of the Republic of Cyprus through the Directorate-General for European Programmes, Coordination and Development.

This growing importance is due to the need for policymakers, urban managers, port authorities, local administrators, shipping companies, couriers, and so on to develop increasingly digitalized and sustainable logistic processes. Therefore, in a global context characterized by intense datafication and globalization of trade, the data-based approach has become a necessary modus operandi to promote smart and sustainable logistics development. This forward-looking model of port logistics uses technologies such as IoT, sensors, cloud computing platforms, Big Data analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), GPS tracking systems, radars, drones, real-time monitoring stations, smart grids, and so on in order to collect, process, monitor and analyse data and information concerning the economic, environmental, social and technological sphere of port cities. In this sense, mobile and fixed platforms help logistics operators to optimize the management of flows (e.g., water, waste, emissions, raw materials, people, monetary investments, etc.) in an efficient and digitized manner. The study proposes a systematic literature review of the most recurring themes concerning smart and sustainable logistics initiatives within port cities in order to develop a multidimensional framework capable of holistically integrating the prevailing enabling factors (Ecosystem, Internal Organization, Data and Security, Policy and Regulation, Finance and Funding, and Digital and Technology), domains (Mobility, Environment, Economy, Telecommunications, Safety and Security, Government, and Community) and goals (Sustainable Development and Digitalization) that characterize smart and sustainable logistical development. To this end, the best practices of several pioneering port cities such as Rotterdam, Hamburg, Singapore, Los Angeles, Amsterdam, etc. implemented in partnerships with technology companies such as Cisco, IBM, Huawei and SAP were also analysed. Therefore, the results of this research show that smart and sustainable logistics initiatives in port cities: (a) have the potential to enhance the efficiency of the economic, environmental, social and technological flows; (b) increase the involvement and awareness of stakeholders such as couriers, shippers, shipping companies, citizens, port authorities, municipalities, security officers, gate and terminal personnel, and so on; and (c) provide a detailed overview of the enabling factors, domains and goals that must be activated by port cities to foster a smart and sustainable logistic transition. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Funding text 1: This research was developed within the Lean&Quality Solutions Lab, University of Messina. The authors thank the Editor and anonymous referees for their valuable observations.; Funding text 2: The design, planning, implementation, development and maintenance of smart and sustainable logistics initiatives are characterized by significant costs ( Balliauw, 2020 ), which make them prohibitive for port cities located in regions with low social, economic, environmental and technological development. In order to overcome these criticalities, several municipal, regional, national and transnational institutions provide financing with restriction on their use in order to support the investments that favour the digitalization of logistic processes and operations within port cities ( Balliauw, Kort, Meersman, Van de Voorde, & Vanelslander, 2020 ). Port city government authorities can establish Special Economic Zones or Zones of Opportunity that benefit from a preferential tax regime for investments in green technologies or grants for research and development activities ( Anna, Anna, & George, 2019 ; Cocconcelli & Medda, 2018 ; Mullins & Burns, 2018 ; Yang, 2009 ). For example, the Chinese government in defining the Hainan Free Trade Port (FTP) guidelines has focused more on tax leverage (zero tariffs and low tax rates) and legal (simplified regulations) as incentives to attract foreign investors ( Wong, 2020 ). In detail, the zero tariff regime is implemented in two phases. In the first phase (before 2025), some categories of imports will have zero tariff treatment in order to develop the tourism, e-commerce and logistics sectors in Hainan FTP. In the second phase (from 2025), a separate tariff regime (e.g. no VAT or consumption tax) will be implemented for a wide range of imports, based on a classification elaborated by the authorities of Hainan FTP ( ITR, 2020 ). Therefore, public funds represent an effective lever to create the social, economic and environmental foundations of innovation, which consequently can incentivize future private sector investments ( Yang, He, Zhu, & Notteboom, 2020 ). For example, the funding underlying the smart and sustainable development of ports of Kapellskär and Naantali in Sweden is based on the integrated use of the European Social Fund (ESF) and the European Regional Development Fund ( Ports of Stockholm, 2020 ). Concerning the port of Kapellskär, the funding includes an automatic mooring system, capable of making dockside operations safer and more efficient. At the same time, the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency has financed the shore-based electricity supply system for ships docked at the quay, which allow them to shut down their engines and operate using electricity provided by the local electricity grid, drastically reducing the environmental impacts on the surrounding context. However, the choice of investments to be financed and included in the overall logistics strategy and those to exclude represents a challenge for policymakers, port managers, planners and urban administrators ( Balliauw, Kort, & Zhang, 2019 ). Port and municipal authorities can develop procurement plans in the logistics and technology sector with requirements that take into account the social, economic, environmental and technological impacts on the community ( Quak, Nesterova, & Kok, 2019 ). Policymakers can also demand how companies will engage the community and mitigate the technology gap by imposing certain investments in specific topics (e.g., broadband connections, blockchain, big data, cloud computing, sensors, etc.). At the same time, port cities can involve entrepreneurs, start-uppers, venture capitalists, technology, logistics and shipping companies, freight forwarders, couriers and other private sector in order to make smart and sustainable logistics investments ( Musso et al., 2006 ).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85104756448,Yes,Italy,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,"AI, IoT",Not Specified,Develop framework for smart and sustainable logistics of port cities,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 14 (Life Below Water)",Conceptual/Theoretical,Qualitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

However, since the limited driving range of BEBs brings challenges for their promotion, the accurate estimation of the driving range with limited available information has become a critical issue for public transport operators. The real-world data collected from 50 BEBs operated in two different cities is used to develop the driving range estimation method by considering the battery degradation effects. Firstly, the incremental capacity analysis method is introduced to characterize the battery performance, and the battery degradation levels under different charging modes are recognized. Afterward, four types of ensemble machine learning (EML) methods are adopted to model the driving range estimation. The BEB driving data, weather condition data and battery degradation levels are used to train and test the models with consideration of 17 impact factors together with two different charging modes. The results indicate that the ensemble machine learning methods have good performance overall, of which the random forest has the highest accuracy. Furthermore, the importance of influencing factors is analysed, and the relevant insights are discussed. © 2021 The Authors.

At an urban level, this study collected various sources of data and proposed a machine learning method (Back Propagation Neural Network - BPNN) to predict different functions of UBCE by BEF in Changxing, a representative small city in China. The study found that UBCE can be significantly affected by BEF such as density, function, and morphology. The BPNN has a good prediction performance on different functions of UBCE, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is stable within 10 %–20 %. The prediction results showed that the average value of different functions of UBCE presented an obvious variation. The carbon emission map showed that the high UBCE are mainly clustered in the middle-east and south of the central city of Changxing. By comparison with other studies, the accuracy of this method was proved. This method could be applied to predict carbon emissions of the urban planning scheme.

In this research, we explore the relationship between “social distancing,” a concept that has gained worldwide familiarity, and urban mobility during the pandemic. Understanding social distancing behavior will allow urban planners and engineers to better understand the new norm of urban mobility amid the pandemic, and what patterns might hold for individual mobility post-pandemic or in the event of a future pandemic. Methods: There are still few efforts to obtain precise information on social distancing patterns of pedestrians in urban environments. This is largely attributed to numerous burdens in safely deploying any effective field data collection approaches during the crisis. This paper aims to fill that gap by developing a data-driven analytical framework that leverages existing public video data sources and advanced computer vision techniques to monitor the evolution of social distancing patterns in urban areas. Specifically, the proposed framework develops a deep-learning approach with a pre-trained convolutional neural network to mine the massive amount of public video data captured in urban areas. Real-time traffic camera data collected in New York City (NYC) was used as a case study to demonstrate the feasibility and validity of using the proposed approach to analyze pedestrian social distancing patterns. Results: The results show that microscopic pedestrian social distancing patterns can be quantified by using a generalized real-distance approximation method. The estimated distance between individuals can be compared to social distancing guidelines to evaluate policy compliance and effectiveness during a pandemic. Quantifying social distancing adherence will provide decision-makers with a better understanding of prevailing social contact challenges. It also provides insights into the development of response strategies and plans for phased reopening for similar future scenarios. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","This work was supported by the Connected Cities for Smart Mobility towards Accessible and Resilient Transportation (C2SMART) Center, a Tier 1 University Center awarded by U.S. Department of Transportation under the University Transportation Centers Program, , and Ulteig.

Hence, better understanding of the contributing factors on its formation ensues ene efficient mitigation of these adverse effects. Previous studies demonstrate a significant correlation between the vertical elevation of urban morphology and UHI, however, topological parameters are barely considered. This study aims to improve the surface UHI prediction by integrating the impact of land surface elevation using a novel parameter of terrain factor (TF), which is integrated with other morphological parameters to develop an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict the spatial distribution of UHI indicated by land surface temperature (LST). Morphological parameters were derived from two case studies representing areas with high terrain variation and relative flat terrain in Illinois, USA. The developed model was utilized to predict the LST for parts of the city, not initially included in the training process. Integration of TF significantly improves the LST predictions for high terrain variation areas, as the average root mean square error decreased from 1.26 to 0.90⁰C and R2 increased from 0.74 to 0.81.

In smart cities, low-frequency oscillations are a serious concern to the power system as they adversely affect system's stability. Moreover, power system stabilizers are inefficient due to their fixed-parameter architecture. Flexible ac transmission system controller performs effective damping of low-frequency oscillations when provided with suitable supplementary damping control like a Static synchronous series compensator. In this context, the paper proposes an adaptive neuro-fuzzy recurrent wavelet control for smart cities that uses the recurrent Gaussian membership function and recurrent wavelet neural network in antecedent and consequent parts respectively. The paper applies the gradient descent optimization with a back-propagation algorithm to update the parameters of suggested adaptive neuro-fuzzy recurrent wavelet control. Simulations are performed on two test systems, both showing the effectiveness of the recommended control scheme as compared to traditional lead-lag control and artificial neuro-fuzzy Takagi Sugeno Kang control.

A promising approach for handling this problem is to introduce intelligent methods to implement a highly effective and efficient cellular traffic prediction model. Meanwhile, integrating the multiaccess edge computing framework in 5G cellular networks facilitates the application of intelligent traffic prediction models by enabling their implementation at the network edge. However, the data shortage and privacy issues may still be obstacles for training a robust and accurate prediction model at the edge. To address these issues, we propose a data-augmentation-based cellular traffic prediction model (ctGAN-S2S), where an effective data augmentation submodel based on generative adversarial networks is proposed to improve the prediction performance while protecting data privacy, and a long-short-term-memory-based sequence-to-sequence submodel is used to achieve the flexible multistep cellular traffic prediction. The experimental results on a real-world city-scale cellular traffic dataset reveal that our ctGAN-S2S model achieves up to 48.49% improvement of the prediction accuracy compared to four typical reference models. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Manuscript received April 11, 2020; revised June 16, 2020; accepted June 26, 2020.

As time and progress have gradually shifted this concept from an idea into a reality, the possibilities for what services a smart city might provide have exploded. Along with that expansion, the number of devices that may need to be supported across a communications network has multiplied enormously. However, existing congestion control protocols are not equipped to support this higher requirement for network performance. New protocols are needed to provide higher data throughputs, reduce queuing delays and packet loss, and maintain stable and reliable communications pathways. The end-to-end congestion control protocol presented in this article does all these things. Called high throughput congestion control (HTCC), the framework takes full advantage of reinforcement learning and a fast growth algorithm to adaptively control the bytes in flight across the network's links to suit the prevailing network conditions. The result is a protocol that not only finds the optimal tradeoff between throughput, latency, and packet loss, but also significantly speeds up the learning process to avoid wasting network resources, use all free bandwidth and maximize network utilization. A comprehensive set of experiments with HTCC and six state-of-the-art protocols - Copa, PCC Vivace, PCC-Allegro, TCP Cubic, TaoVA-100x, and FillP-Sheep - demonstrate that, in most conditions, HTCC is able to make the best tradeoff between throughput, delay, and loss rate. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Manuscript received April 30, 2020; revised June 18, 2020; accepted June 23, 2020.

People use multiple scientific advancements such as the Internet of Things (IoT) for data acquisition and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for big data analytics to enhance the integration and sharing of data and optimize the basic standards of smart cities. Past few years, the concept behind the Internet of Things has been a major research topic in the development of smart cities, education, industry, and commerce. Services and applications of IoT are the major factors for creating a sustainable urban life that is employed by smart cities. The stakeholders of smart cities become more aware, efficient, and interactive using Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in IoT. The applications of smart cities based on IoT have been increased in number which leads to production and increase in the amount of data and its processing. Moreover, the city stakeholders and governments take prior actions/precautions for processing the collected data from the IoT devices and predicting the future consequences for securing a sustainable environment. Artificial Intelligence is one of the key research techniques which several researchers have analysed and proved to be the best in improving the performance of detecting fire hazard in smart cities. In this research, a Deep Belief Network (DBN) with Recurrent LSTM Neural Network (R-LSTM-NN) is proposed for prediction of big data that are collected from smart cities based on IoT. Moreover, the proposed model mainly concentrates in predicting the fire hazard values that gathered from smart cities using IoT devices. The simulation results show that the proposed technique proves to be better when compared with other existing techniques in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 score. The proposed model detects the fire outbreak with a 98.4% of accuracy that having 0.14% of minimal error rate. Furthermore, the proposed model can be used for various prediction problems that are faced by smart cities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","This work was supported by the Jiangsu Province University Natural Science Foundation Project, Study on Key Technologies of Big Data Processing Based on Cloud Computing (Grant No. 19KJB520029).

Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, United States","Iraq and Kuwait are in a region of the world known to be impacted by high levels of fine particulate matter (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) attributable to sources that include desert dust and ambient pollution, but historically have had limited pollution monitoring networks. The inability to assess PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations have limited the assessment of the health impact of these exposures, both in the native populations and previously deployed military personnel. As part of a Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program health study of land-based U.S. military personnel who were previously deployed to these countries, we developed a novel approach to estimate spatially and temporarily resolved daily PM<inf>2.5</inf> exposures 2001–2018. Since visibility is proportional to ground-level particulate matter concentrations, we were able to take advantage of extensive airport visibility data that became available as a result of regional military operations over this time period. First, we combined a random forest machine learning and a generalized additive mixed model to estimate daily high resolution (1 km × 1 km) visibility over the region using satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) and airport visibility data. The spatially and temporarily resolved visibility data were then used to estimate PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations from 2001 to 2018 by converting visibility to PM<inf>2.5</inf> using empirical relationships derived from available regional PM<inf>2.5</inf> monitoring stations. We adjusted for spatially resolved meteorological parameters, land use variables, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and satellite-derived estimates of surface dust as a measure of sandstorm activity. Cross validation indicated good model predictive ability (R2 = 0.71), and there were considerable spatial and temporal differences in PM<inf>2.5</inf> across the region. Annual average PM<inf>2.5</inf> predictions for Iraq and Kuwait were 37 and 41 μg/m3, respectively, which are greater than current U.S. and WHO standards. PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations in many U.S. bases and large cities (e.g. Bagdad, Balad, Kuwait city, Karbala, Najaf, and Diwaniya) had annual average PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentrations above 45 μg/m3 with weekly averages as high as 150 μg/m3 depending on calendar year. The highest annual PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentration for both Kuwait and Iraq were observed in 2008, followed by 2009, which was associated with extreme drought in these years. The lowest PM<inf>2.5</inf> values were observed in 2014. On average, July had the highest concentrations, and November had the lowest values, consistent with seasonal patterns of air pollution in this region. This is the first study that estimates long-term PM<inf>2.5</inf> exposures in Iraq and Kuwait at a high resolution based on measurements data that will allow the study of health effects and contribute to the development of regional environmental policies. The novel approach demonstrated may be used in other parts of the world with limited monitoring networks. © 2021 The Author(s)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the VA Cooperative Studies Program #595: Pulmonary Health and Deployment to Southwest Asia and Afghanistan, from the United States (U.S.) Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Research and Development, Clinical Science Research and Development, Cooperative Studies Program.

Due to the high frequency noise and complicated relationships in water demand series, forecasting the urban water demand is not an easy task. In order to improve the model's abilities in handling the complex patterns and catching the peaks in time series, we propose a hybrid long short-term memory model combining with discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and principal component analysis (PCA) pre-processing techniques for water demand forecasting, i.e., DWT-PCA-LSTM. First, the outliers of water demand series are identified and smoothed by 3σ criterion and weighted average method, respectively. Then, the noise component of water demand series is eliminated by DWT method and the principal components (PCs) among influencing factors of water demand are selected by PCA method. In addition, two LSTM networks are built to yield the daily urban water demand predictions using the results of DWT and PCA techniques. At last, the superiorities of the proposed model are demonstrated by comparing with the other benchmark predictive models. The water demand from 2016 to 2020 of a waterworks located in Suzhou, China is used for the experiment.

Smart mobility systems aim to support the efficient exploitation of city transport facilities and sustainable mobility within the urban environment. People need to travel quickly and conveniently between locations at different scales, ranging from a few blocks within a city to a journey across cities. At the same time, goods need to be timely delivered, considering both the users and the businesses' needs. Several cities indicated an interest in using Autonomous Vehicles (AV) for the 'last-mile' mobility services in the last few years. With them, it seems to be easier to get people and goods around using fewer vehicles. In this context, Autonomous Shuttles (AS) are beginning to be thought of as a new mobility/delivery service into the city center where narrow streets are not easily served by traditional buses. They allow them to perform critical areas with minimal new infrastructure and reduce noise and pollution. The article analyses the state-of-art on autonomous shuttles by proposing four application scenarios targeting the last-mile delivery of goods, the tourist experiences, and the shared and integrated mobility. Furthermore, we contribute with the proposition of the Autonomous Shuttles-as-a service (ASaaS) concept as the key pillar for the realization of innovative and sustainable proximity mobility. Our research proposed new research challenges for ASaaS, and we discuss social implications and governance challenges that consider user engagement and sustainability. It also recommended extending new research to focus on simulation and machine learning techniques for last-mile mobility planning and explore the journeys tracking certification via artificial intelligence and blockchain-based techniques. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097017596,Yes,Italy,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,AI (General),Not Specified,"Study challenges, opportunities and social implications of Autonomous Shuttle-as-a-Service","SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Conceptual/Theoretical,Qualitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

YOLOv2 is designed with light-weight neural network architecture to account the requirements of embedded platforms. The training stage is processed off-line with indoor and outdoor fire and smoke image sets in different indoor and outdoor scenarios. Ground truth labeler app is used to generate the ground truth data from the training set. The trained model was tested and compared to the other state-of-the-art methods. We used a large scale of fire/smoke and negative videos in different environments, both indoor (e.g., a railway carriage, container, bus wagon, or home/office) or outdoor (e.g., storage or parking area). YOLOv2 is a better option compared to the other approaches for real-time fire/smoke detection. This work has been deployed in a low-cost embedded device (Jetson Nano), which is composed of a single, fixed camera per scene, working in the visible spectral range. There are not specific requirements for the video camera. Hence, when the proposed solution is applied for safety on-board vehicles, or in transport infrastructures, or smart cities, the camera installed in closed-circuit television surveillance systems can be reused. The achieved experimental results show that the proposed solution is suitable for creating a smart and real-time video-surveillance system for fire/smoke detection. © 2020, The Author(s).",Funding text 1: Work partially supported by Dipartimento di Eccellenza Crosslab Project by MIUR.

License plate detection (LPD) is a critical process in automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) that reduces complexity by delimiting the search space for subsequent ALPR stages. It is complicated by unfavourable factors including environmental conditions, occlusion, and license plate variation. As such, it requires training models on substantial volumes of relevant images per use case. In 2018, the new Mercosur standard came in to effect in four South American countries. Access to large volumes of actual Mercosur license plates with sufficient presentation variety is a significant challenge for training supervised models for LPD, thereby adversely impacting the efficacy of ALPR in Mercosur countries. This paper presents a novel license plate embedding methodology for generating large volumes of accurate Mercosur license plate images sufficient for training supervised LPD. We validate this methodology with a deep learning-based ALPR using a convolutional neural network trained exclusively with synthetic data and tested with real parking lot and traffic camera images.

Generally, in smart cities where distributed things have access to computational resources, data transfer becomes inevitable because of high latency, thereby resulting in crucial situations. Even though numerous technologies have emerged for improving the data communication among geo-distributed devices received from the cloud server but still, it lags in low learning performance. To address these challenges, an innovative artificial intelligence (AI) based edge node (E-Node) algorithm is implemented to optimize the edge to edge learning for well-organized data migration. To attain high reliability, AI-K-means neural network (KNN) and convolution neural network (CNN) is used initially for pre-processing and filtering the edge node. Further, the proposed E-Node algorithm outperforms the optimization technique effectively through the edge to edge computing The reliability performance is increased by reducing the node optimization time from 132 to 98 ms for 25 kb data and data transmission time is reduced from 93 to 45 ms for 80 kb data, thus reducing the latency in an edge envisioned environment. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85090950000,Yes,India,Infrastructure,Smart City Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,AI (Edge Node Algorithm),Optimization,Enable efficient data transfer in edge environment using AI-based edge node algorithm,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

However, recent developments of machine learning within Big Data environment have not been exploited enough in this domain. This paper aims to answer the question of how to incorporate Big Data platform and machine learning into an intelligent system for managing energy efficiency of public sector as a substantial part of the smart city concept. Deep neural networks, Rpart regression tree and Random forest with variable reduction procedures were used to create prediction models of specific energy consumption of Croatian public sector buildings. The most accurate model was produced by Random forest method, and a comparison of important predictors extracted by all three methods has been conducted. The models could be implemented in the suggested intelligent system named MERIDA which integrates Big Data collection and predictive models of energy consumption for each energy source in public buildings, and enables their synergy into a managing platform for improving energy efficiency of the public sector within Big Data environment. The paper also discusses technological requirements for developing such a platform that could be used by public administration to plan reconstruction measures of public buildings, to reduce energy consumption and cost, as well as to connect such smart public buildings as part of smart cities. Such digital transformation of energy management can increase energy efficiency of public administration, its higher quality of service and healthier environment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",This work was supported by Croatian Science Foundation through research grant IP-2016-06-8350 “Methodological framework for efficient energy management by intelligent data analytics” MERIDA.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078529920,Yes,Croatia,Energy,Smart Grid & Energy,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Machine Learning,Multiple,Develop ML-based system for managing energy efficiency of public sector toward smart cities,"SDG 7 (Energy), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

The emergence of advanced technologies such as cloud-based services, internet of things (IoT), and big data analytics has augmented the growth of global data centers, leading to high energy consumption. This upsurge in energy consumption of the data centers not only incurs the issue of surging high cost (operational and maintenance) but also has an adverse effect on the environment. Dynamic power management in a data center environment requires the cognizance of the correlation between the system and hardware-level performance counters and the power consumption. Power consumption modeling exhibits this correlation and is crucial in designing energy-efficient optimization strategies based on resource utilization. Several works in power modeling are proposed and used in the literature. However, these power models have been evaluated using different benchmarking applications, power-measurement techniques, and error-calculation formulas on different machines. In this work, we present a taxonomy and evaluation of 24 software-based power models using a unified environment, benchmarking applications, power-measurement techniques, and error formulas, with the aim of achieving an objective comparison. We use different server architectures to assess the impact of heterogeneity on the models' comparison. The performance analysis of these models is elaborated in the article. © 2020 ACM.","This work is supported by the Emirates Center for Energy and Environment Research of the United Arab Emirates University under Grant 31R101.

It is important to quickly and accurately extract the location and outline of buildings from high-resolution remote sensing images for earthquake disaster assessment, urban and rural planning management, smart city construction, and other fields. However, it is challenging to extract buildings accurately from high-resolution remote sensing images due to the complexity of ground features and the occlusion phenomenon. The classic building extraction algorithms usually have incomplete results with many wrong detections and missed detections. The deep-level feature extraction method of deep learning is very suitable for the extraction of buildings from high-resolution images. However, for the existing researches using deep learning algorithms, most algorithms are optimized by changing the network structure and are rarely combined with other methods. The pertinence of building extraction is not strong. This paper not only studies the influence of the internal structure of the convolutional neural network in deep learning on the extraction results, but also studies the combination of ambiguity, Morphological Building Index (MBI) with deep learning. The main improvements in this paper are as follows: (1) Based on the DeepLab v3+ network structure, we propose the PwDeepLab network which improves feature fusion methods and loss functions; (2) We propose a blur degree constraint method. We define a new blur degree formula to evaluate the image blur degree. In the case of a fixed image block size, the image is upsampled and enhanced by the image blur degree constraint; (3) We propose a morphological index constraint method. The pixels of the original image are stretched and enhanced where the Morphological Building Index (MBI) is above the threshold. Therefore, the building information can be highlighted with less changes to the original image characteristics. Our method is verified using the Massachusetts dataset and the satellite dataset II (East Asia) of Wuhan University. The main building types of the two datasets are quite different. As a result, the accuracy of the proposed method on the two datasets increases by 10.9% and 3.8%, respectively, compared with DeepLab v3+, and increases by 10.0% and 9.6%, respectively, compared with U-Net. The higher accuracy reflects the superiority and robustness of our method. Moreover, the extracted results match the real labels very well in details. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper can significantly improve the building extraction results. © 2021, Science Press.

Adapting treatment process operations accordingly is challenging due to a lack of analytical capacity for characterization and monitoring at many treatment plants. Cost-efficient and simple field measurements such as photographs and probe readings could be proxies for process control parameters that normally require laboratory analysis. To investigate this, we evaluated questionnaire data, expert assessments, and simple analytical measurements for fecal sludge collected from 421 onsite containments. This data served as inputs to models of varying complexity. Random forest and linear regression models were able to predict physical-chemical characteristics including total solids (TS) and ammonium (NH<inf>4</inf>+-N) concentrations, and solid-liquid separation performance including settling efficiency and filtration time (R2 from 0.51-0.66) based on image analysis of photographs (sludge color, supernatant color, and texture) and probe readings (conductivity (EC) and pH). Supernatant color was the best predictor of settling efficiency and filtration time, EC was the best predictor of NH<inf>4</inf>+-N, and texture was the best predictor of TS. Predictive models have the potential to be applied for real-time monitoring and process control if a database of measurements is developed and models are validated in other cities. Simple decision tree models based on the single classifier of containment type can also be used to make predictions about citywide planning, where a lower degree of accuracy is required. © 2021 The Authors","Samples and questionnaire data were collected as part of the “Faecal sludge quantities and qualities (Q&Q) in Lusaka” project, supported by the German Corporation for International Cooperation GmbH (GIZ).

Link prediction is an important task of data mining, especially in the knowledge graph, which is also called knowledge graph completion. Link prediction aims to find missing links or predict potential links according to the current social network. The most existing link prediction methods focus on static information in social networks, such as topology and node attributes, which are partly provided by users. When users are unwilling to provide or intentionally hide these static features, traditional link prediction methods cannot achieve ideal performance. The dynamic information of social influence propagation in social networks can avoid the user's subjective impact and better reflect the relationship between users. In addition, users show different degrees of interest and authority on various topics in the real world, leading to different influence propagation patterns. Therefore, we use context of social influence to optimize the topic-aware influence propagation model to improve the performance of link prediction. In this paper, we propose a new multi-output graph neural network framework to capture influence propagation in social networks and model the influence of users in different roles. In this way, the underlying information of influence between users can be used to construct new features to improve the performance of link prediction. Our experiments conduct the method on multiple benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that the modeling of context is effective, and our model outperforms the compared state-of-the-art link prediction methods. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","This work was supported partly by National Natural Science Foundation of China (61772268, 62003379), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (NT2018028, NS2018057), China Degree and Graduate Education Fund, and CCF-Huawei Database System Innovation Research Plan (CCF-HUAWEIDBIR2020001A).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102463635,No,China,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the models are often complex and hardly interpretable for the developers and operators. Indeed, the model interpretations are beneficial in multifold such as for system inspection and optimization. In this article, we propose an interpretable thermal comfort system to introduce interpretability to any black-box comfort models. First, we focus on the relationship between a model's input features and output comfort level. The feature impact on comfort is investigated and the impact patterns are shown to be diverse for different features. Second, we unveil the model mechanisms about the data processing inside the model by building the model surrogates based on the interpretable machine learning algorithms. The surrogates offer outstanding fidelity for simulating the actual model mechanisms and the interpretations based on the surrogates are intuitive and informative. Our interpretable comfort system can be integrated with the existing building management systems.

At present, most researches on architecture sunlight pollution traditionally focus a local small range at specific construction based on simulation or measurement methods. We keep the way of three-dimensional (3D) computation, dissimilarly integrates geographic resources to expand the perception range of city sunlight pollution brought by building glasses. Methods: The calculation technique of sunlight pollution builds 3D spatial relationship among road, building façade and sunlight in real urban environment, using deep-learning image segmentation to extract glass curtain walls. Then, combined with glare evaluation model, we develop an innovative sunlight pollution model from perspective of drivers to evaluate the suitability for people. Results: Taking Shenzhen Futian Center as an example, the multi-level analyses of sunlight pollution are implemented by means of calculation under real time and real location, and path selection based on evaluation. Through these instances, the time sequence regularity, the spatial distribution characteristics and the path estimation of architecture sunlight pollution are revealed. Conclusions: The analyses retain space computation mode with innovations, fully utilize street view resources, and provide people the macroscopic concept, which indicates relative strength of building sunlight pollution. Additionally, the method ensures instantaneity of urban sunlight pollution acquisition and computation, to a certain extent covers shortages of current researches, and is further capable of reference evaluation in environment protection, accurate warnings and predictions of glare intensity for pedestrians and drivers. © 2021, Editorial Board of Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University.

The study includes 46 small and medium-sized towns in Hungary. The methodology of the study is mainly provided by a model that can be used for this purpose; however, the results obtained with the traditional regression method are compared with the results of another, more complex estimation method, the artificial neural network, which has the advantage of being able to use different types of models. The focus of our article is on methodological alignment, not necessarily the discovery of new results. Certain demographic characteristics significantly determine the energy demand of a household sector in a municipality. In this case, as the ratio of people aged 60 or over within a city rises by 1%, the urban household average energy consumption decreases by 61 kilowatt hours, and when it rises by 1%, the amount of pollutants expelled from urban households’ average energy consumption may decrease by 22.8745 kg. The research area of our paper was greatly influenced by the availability of the statistical data. The results can be used in the planning of urban developments. ©: © 2021 by the authors.

However, due to security problems in such war-ravaged countries as Afghanistan, the traditional forms of public participation in the planning process are untenable. In particular, due to gathering space difficulties and culture issues in Afghanistan, women and religious minorities are restricted from joining male-dominated powerholders’ face-to-face meetings which are nearly always held in fixed places called masjids (religious buildings). Furthermore, conducting such discussions with human facilitation biases the generation of citizen decisions that stimulates an atmosphere of confrontation, causing another decision problem for urban policy-making institutions. Therefore, it is critical to find approaches that not only securely revolutionize participative processes but also provide meaningful and equal public consultation to support interactions among stakehold-ers to solve their shared problems together. Toward this end, we propose a joint research program, namely, crowd-based communicative and deliberative e-planning (CCDP), a blended approach, which is a mixture of using an artificial-intelligence-led technology, decision-support system called D-Agree and experimental participatory planning in Kabul, Afghanistan. For the sake of real-world implementation, Nagoya Institute of Technology (Japan) and Kabul Municipality (Afghanistan) have formed a novel developed and developing world partnership by using our proposed methodology as an emerging-deliberation mechanism to reframe public participation in urban planning processes. In the proposed program, Kabul municipality agreed to use our methodology when Kabul city needs to make a plan with people. This digital field study presents the first practical example of using online decision support systems in the context of the neighborhood functions of Gozars, which are Kabul’s social and spatial urban units. The main objective was to harness the wisdom of the crowd to innovative suggestions for helping policymakers making strategic development plans for Gozars using open call ideas, and for responding to equal participation and consultation needs, specifically for women and minorities. This article presents valuable insights into the benefits of this combined approach as blended experience for societies and cities that are suffering long-term distress. This initiative has influenced other local Afghan governments, including the cities of Kandahar and Herat as well as the country’s central government’s ministry of urban planning and land, which has officially expressed its intention to collaborate with us. © 2021 by the authors.

From a review of a limited number of studies, the common methods for forecasting tour traffic demand appear to be regression analysis, econometric modeling, time-series modeling, artificial neural networks, and gray theory. In this study, a two-step procedure is used to build a predictive model for public transport. In the first step of this study, regression analysis is used to find the correlations between two or more variables and their associated directions and strength, and the regression function is used to predict future changes. In the second step, the regression analysis and artificial neural network methods are assessed and the results are compared. The artificial neural network is more accurate in prediction than regression analysis. The study results can provide useful references for transportation organizations in the development of business operation strategies for managing sustainable smart cities. © 2021 by the authors.

Various methods including geometric, radiometric, object based and edge detection were previously deliberated and implemented in different studies in the context of building extraction. Nevertheless, the reliability of extraction process is mainly subject to user intervention. The current study proposes a new automatic morphology-based approach for extracting buildings using high-resolution satellite images of Al-Hudaybiyah region in the city of Makkah as a case study. The proposed technique integrates the support vector machine for extracting buildings that have bright and dark roofs. The appropriateness of this method has been examined by means of various indicators for example completeness, correctness and quality.

Hyperspectral data are increasingly being considered for exploring levels of urbanization, due to their capability to capture the spectral variability that a modern urban landscape offers. Data and algorithms are two sides of a coin: while the data capture the variations, the algorithms provide suitable methods to extract relevant information. The literature reports a variety of algorithms for extraction of urban information from any given data, with varying accuracies. This article aims to explore the binary-classifier approach to target detection to extract certain features. Roads and roofs are the most common features present in any urban scene. These experiments were conducted on a subset of AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral data from the Udaipur region of India, with roads and roofs as targets. Four categories of target-detection algorithms are identified from a literature survey and our previous experience—distance measures, angle-based measures, information measures, and machinelearning measures—followed by performance evaluation. The article also presents a brief taxonomy of algorithms; explores methods such as the Mahalanobis angle, which has been reported to be effective for extraction of urban targets; and explores newer machine-learning algorithms to increase accuracy.

This study proposes a methodology for inferring the bike trip purpose based on bike-share and point-ofinterest (POI) data. Because the purpose of a trip involves decision-making, its inference necessitates an understanding of the spatiotemporal complexity of human activities. Thus, the spatiotemporal features affecting bike trips were selected from the bike-share data, and the land uses at the origin and destination of the trips were extracted from the POI data. During POI type embedding, the data were augmented considering the geographical distance between the POIs and the number of bike rentals at each bike station. We further developed a ground truth data construction method that uses temporal mobile and POI data. The inference model was built using machine learning and applied to experiments involving bike stations in Seocho-gu, Seoul, Korea. The experimental results revealed that optimal performance was achieved with the use of decision tree algorithms, as demonstrated by a 78.95% overall accuracy and 66.43% F1-score. The proposed method contributes to a better understanding of the causes of movement within cities. © 2021 by the authors.

This fact has favored both its large-scale implementation and small-scale Distributed Generation (DG). PV systems integrated into local distribution systems are considered to be one of the keys to a sustainable future built environment in Smart Cities (SC). Advanced Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of solar PV plants is necessary. Powerful and accurate data are usually obtained on-site by means of current-voltage (I-V) curves or electroluminescence (EL) images, with new equipment and methodologies recently proposed. In this work, authors present a comparison between five AI-based models to classify PV solar cells according to their state, using EL images at the PV solar cell level, while the cell I-V curves are used in the training phase to be able to classify the cells based on its production efficiency. This automatic classification of defective cells enormously facilitates the identification of defects for PV plant operators, decreasing the human labor and optimizing the defect location.

It presents a proposal for shifting from a traditional approach for generating general-purpose one-size-fits-all geodemographic classifications to application-specific classifications. This proposal addresses the recent scepticism towards the utility of general-purpose applications by employing supervised machine learning techniques in order to identify contextually relevant input variables from which to develop geodemographic classifications with increased discriminatory power. A framework introducing such techniques in the variable selection phase of geodemographic classification development is presented via a practical use-case that is focused on generating a geodemographic classification with an increased capacity for discriminating the propensity for Library use in the UK city of Leeds. Two local classifications are generated for the city, one a general-purpose classification, and the other, an application-specific classification incorporating supervised Feature Selection methods in the selection of input variables. The discriminatory power of each classification is evaluated and compared, with the result successfully demonstrating the capacity for the application-specific approach to generate a more contextually relevant result, and thus underpins increasingly targeted public policy decision making, particularly in the context of urban planning. © 2021 by the authors.

Each sensor device continuously runs on battery-operated power, consuming energy while perceiving target information in a particular environment. To reduce sensor device energy consumption in real-time IoT tracking applications, many traditional methods such as clustering, information-driven, and other approaches have previously been utilized to select the best sensor. However, applying machine learning methods, particularly deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL), to address the problem of sensor selection in tracking applications is quite demanding because of the limited sensor node battery lifetime. In this study, we proposed a long short-term memory deep Q-network (DQN)-based Deep RL target tracking model to overcome the problem of energy consumption in IoT target applications. The proposed method is utilized to select the energy-efficient best sensor while tracking the target. The best sensor is defined by the minimum distance function (i.e., derived as the state), which leads to lower energy consumption. The simulation results show favorable features in terms of the best sensor selection and energy consumption. © 2021 by the authors.

In reality, Australia is very far away from addressing the societal level drivers of health inequity. There is little progressive policy that touches on the conditions of daily life that matter for health, and action to redress inequities in power, money and resources is almost non-existent. In this chapter we ask you to pause this reality and come on a fantastic journey where we envisage how COVID-19 was a great disruptor and accelerator of positive progressive action. We offer glimmers of what life could be like if there was committed and real policy action on the social determinants of health equity. It is vital that the health sector assists in convening the multisectoral stakeholders necessary to turn this fantasy into reality. Chapter 2: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander connection to culture: building stronger individual and collective wellbeing: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have long maintained that culture (ie, practising, maintaining and reclaiming it) is vital to good health and wellbeing. However, this knowledge and understanding has been dismissed or described as anecdotal or intangible by Western research methods and science. As a result, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture is a poorly acknowledged determinant of health and wellbeing, despite its significant role in shaping individuals, communities and societies. By extension, the cultural determinants of health have been poorly defined until recently. However, an increasing amount of scientific evidence supports what Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have always said — that strong culture plays a significant and positive role in improved health and wellbeing. Owing to known gaps in knowledge, we aim to define the cultural determinants of health and describe their relationship with the social determinants of health, to provide a full understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander wellbeing. We provide examples of evidence on cultural determinants of health and links to improved Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and wellbeing. We also discuss future research directions that will enable a deeper understanding of the cultural determinants of health for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Chapter 3: Physical determinants of health: healthy, liveable and sustainable communities: Good city planning is essential for protecting and improving human and planetary health. Until recently, however, collaboration between city planners and the public health sector has languished. We review the evidence on the health benefits of good city planning and propose an agenda for public health advocacy relating to health-promoting city planning for all by 2030. Over the next 10 years, there is an urgent need for public health leaders to collaborate with city planners — to advocate for evidence-informed policy, and to evaluate the health effects of city planning efforts. Importantly, we need integrated planning across and between all levels of government and sectors, to create healthy, liveable and sustainable cities for all. Chapter 4: Health promotion in the Anthropocene: the ecological determinants of health: Human health is inextricably linked to the health of the natural environment. In this chapter, we focus on ecological determinants of health, including the urgent and critical threats to the natural environment, and opportunities for health promotion arising from the human health co-benefits of actions to protect the health of the planet. We characterise ecological determinants in the Anthropocene and provide a sobering snapshot of planetary health science, particularly the momentous climate change health impacts in Australia. We highlight Australia’s position as a major fossil fuel producer and exporter, and a country lacking cohesive and timely emissions reduction policy. We offer a roadmap for action, with four priority directions, and point to a scaffold of guiding approaches — planetary health, Indigenous people’s knowledge systems, ecological economics, health co-benefits and climate-resilient development. Our situation requires a paradigm shift, and this demands a recalibration of health promotion education, research and practice in Australia over the coming decade. Chapter 5: Disrupting the commercial determinants of health: Our vision for 2030 is an Australian economy that promotes optimal human and planetary health for current and future generations. To achieve this, current patterns of corporate practice and consumption of harmful commodities and services need to change. In this chapter, we suggest ways forward for Australia, focusing on pragmatic actions that can be taken now to redress the power imbalances between corporations and Australian governments and citizens. We begin by exploring how the terms of health policy making must change to protect it from conflicted commercial interests. We also examine how marketing unhealthy products and services can be more effectively regulated, and how healthier business practices can be incentivised. Finally, we make recommendations on how various public health stakeholders can hold corporations to account, to ensure that people come before profits in a healthy and prosperous future Australia. Chapter 6: Digital determinants of health: the digital transformation: We live in an age of rapid and exponential technological change. Extraordinary digital advancements and the fusion of technologies, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things and quantum computing constitute what is often referred to as the digital revolution or the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0). Reflections on the future of public health and health promotion require thorough consideration of the role of digital technologies and the systems they influence. Just how the digital revolution will unfold is unknown, but it is clear that advancements and integrations of technologies will fundamentally influence our health and wellbeing in the future. The public health response must be proactive, involving many stakeholders, and thoughtfully considered to ensure equitable and ethical applications and use. Chapter 7: Governance for health and equity: a vision for our future: Coronavirus disease 2019 has caused many people and communities to take stock on Australia’s direction in relation to health, community, jobs, environmental sustainability, income and wealth. A desire for change is in the air. This chapter imagines how changes in the way we govern our lives and what we value as a society could solve many of the issues Australia is facing — most pressingly, the climate crisis and growing economic and health inequities. We present an imagined future for 2030 where governance structures are designed to ensure transparent and fair behaviour from those in power and to increase the involvement of citizens in these decisions, including a constitutional voice for Indigenous peoples. We imagine that these changes were made by measuring social progress in new ways, ensuring taxation for public good, enshrining human rights (including to health) in legislation, and protecting and encouraging an independent media. Measures to overcome the climate crisis were adopted and democratic processes introduced in the provision of housing, education and community development. © 2021 AMPCo Pty Ltd","Funding text 1: This chapter is part of a supplement funded by the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation (VicHealth).

Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje, Skopje, North Macedonia","The Internet of things (IoT) has emerged as a topic of intense interest among the research and industrial community as it has had a revolutionary impact on human life. The rapid growth of IoT technology has revolutionized human life by inaugurating the concept of smart devices, smart healthcare, smart industry, smart city, smart grid, among others. IoT devices’ security has become a serious concern nowadays, especially for the healthcare domain, where recent attacks exposed damaging IoT security vulnerabilities. Traditional network security solutions are well established. However, due to the resource constraint property of IoT devices and the distinct behavior of IoT protocols, the existing security mechanisms cannot be deployed directly for securing the IoT devices and network from the cyber-attacks. To enhance the level of security for IoT, researchers need IoT-specific tools, methods, and datasets. To address the mentioned problem, we provide a framework for developing IoT context-aware security solutions to detect malicious traffic in IoT use cases. The proposed framework consists of a newly created, open-source IoT data generator tool named IoT-Flock. The IoT-Flock tool allows researchers to develop an IoT use-case comprised of both normal and malicious IoT devices and generate traffic. Additionally, the proposed framework provides an open-source utility for converting the captured traffic generated by IoT-Flock into an IoT dataset. Using the proposed framework in this research, we first generated an IoT healthcare dataset which comprises both normal and IoT attack traffic. Afterwards, we applied different machine learning techniques to the generated dataset to detect the cyber-attacks and protect the healthcare system from cyber-attacks. The proposed framework will help in developing the context-aware IoT security solutions, especially for a sensitive use case like IoT healthcare environment. © 2021 by the authors.

This is being realized through digital platforms such as social media that have increasingly become convenient and inexpensive sensors compared to physical sensors in many sectors of smart societies. One such major sector is road transportation, which is the backbone of modern economies and costs globally 1.25 million deaths and 50 million human injuries annually. The cutting-edge on big data-enabled social media analytics for transportation-related studies is limited. This paper brings a range of technologies together to detect road traffic-related events using big data and distributed machine learning. The most specific contribution of this research is an automatic labelling method for machine learning-based traffic-related event detection from Twitter data in the Arabic language. The proposed method has been implemented in a software tool called Iktishaf+ (an Arabic word meaning discovery) that is able to detect traffic events automatically from tweets in the Arabic language using distributed machine learning over Apache Spark. The tool is built using nine components and a range of technologies including Apache Spark, Parquet, and MongoDB. Iktishaf+ uses a light stemmer for the Arabic language developed by us. We also use in this work a location extractor developed by us that allows us to extract and visualize spatio-tem-poral information about the detected events. The specific data used in this work comprises 33.5 million tweets collected from Saudi Arabia using the Twitter API. Using support vector machines, naïve Bayes, and logistic regression-based classifiers, we are able to detect and validate several real events in Saudi Arabia without prior knowledge, including a fire in Jeddah, rains in Makkah, and an accident in Riyadh. The findings show the effectiveness of Twitter media in detecting important events with no prior knowledge about them. © 2021 by the authors.

Finding the insights of all these complex data is of great significance to vehicle dispatching and public safety. In this work, we propose a multitask deep learning model called Multitask Recurrent Graph Convolutional Network (MRGCN) for accurately predicting traffic flows in the city. Specifically, we design a multitask framework consisting of four components: a region-flow encoder for modeling region-flow dynamics, a transition-flow encoder for exploring transition-flow correlations, a context modeling component for contextualized fusion of two types of traffic flows and a task-specific decoder for predicting traffic flows. Particularly, we introduce Dual-attention Graph Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (DGCGRU) to simultaneously capture spatial and temporal dependencies, which integrate graph convolution and recurrent model as a whole.

To offset the adverse effects, a new form of greening, termed as the green roof, is becoming one of the remedies. Previous studies and practice have validated the positive impacts of green roofs on atmospheric environment improvement, but the large-scale quantitative studies and the related urban planning still show that difficulties exist in obtaining the overall area and spatial morphological pattern of green roofs from the massive building stock. In this study, we presented a novel method based on deep learning to recognize the rooftops available and simulated the atmospheric pollutants removal potential (APRP) of green roofs in visualization. Compared with traditional methods, our method was more accurate and efficient. In this study, we recovered a trained neural network model and achieved a satisfactory 94.17% validation accuracy. According to our results, Shijiazhuang City offered great potential that if all the selected rooftops installed green roofs, 1.210465×106 kg/year pollutants would be cleaned up with dry deposition.

The pandemic has an influential impact on almost everything and the characteristics of the pandemic remain unclear. This ultimately leads to ineffective strategic planning to manage the pandemic. This study aims to elucidate the typical pandemic characteristics in line with various temporal phases and its associated measures that proved effective in controlling the pandemic. Besides, an insight into diverse country's approaches towards pandemic and their consequences is provided in brief. Understanding the role of technologies in supporting humanity gives new perspectives to effectively manage the pandemic. Such role of technologies is expressed from the viewpoint of seamless connectivity, rapid communication, mobility, technological influence in healthcare, digitalization influence, surveillance and security, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Internet of Things (IoT). Furthermore, some insightful scenarios are framed where the full-fledged implementation of technologies is assumed, and the reflected pandemic impacts in such scenarios are analyzed. The framed scenarios revolve around the digitalized energy sector, an enhanced supply chain system with effective customer-retailer relationships to support the city during the pandemic scenario, and an advanced tracking system for containing virus spread. The study is further extended to frame revitalization strategies to highlight the expertise where significant attention needs to be provided in the post-pandemic period as well as to nurture sustainable development. Finally, the current pandemic scenario is analyzed in terms of occurred changes and is mapped into SWOT factors. Using Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution based Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis, these SWOT factors are analyzed to determine where prioritized efforts are needed to focus so as to traverse towards sustainable cities. The results indicate that the enhanced crisis management ability and situational need to restructure the economic model emerges to be the most-significant SWOT factor that can ultimately support humanity for making the cities sustainable. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","The authors would like to thank Tim McSweeney, Australia for providing useful suggestions and proofreading support that enhanced the quality of this paper.

Green IoT applications based on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are developed in various domains, such as medical, engineering, industry, and smart cities to grow the production. To increase the performance of sustainable cities, communicating nodes are interconnected autonomously to observe the environment, where they need to be more energy-efficient. Edge computing operates in a distributed manner and improves the response time with the least latency through various edge servers. Although the integration of edge computing and Green IoT significantly improves the network performance in terms of computation and data storage, low powered sensors have constraints in terms of battery power, low transmission range, and security aspects. Therefore, adopting an emerging solution is needed to offer energy services with secure data delivery for sustainable cities. This paper presents an intelligent and secure edge-enabled computing (ISEC) model for sustainable cities using Green IoT, which aims to develop the communication strategy with decreasing the liability in terms of energy management and data security for data transportation. The proposed model generates optimal features using deep learning for data routing, which may help to train the sensors for predicting the finest routes toward edge servers. Moreover, the integration of distributed hashing with chaining strategy eases security solutions with efficient computing system. The experimental results reveal the improved performance of the proposed ISEC model against other solutions for energy consumption by 21 %, network throughput by 15 %, end-to-end delay by 12 %, route interruption by 36 %, and network overhead by 52 %. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","The authors are grateful to the Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University for funding through Vice Deanship of Scientific Research Chairs .",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85101360174,Yes,Chile,Urban Design,Urban Planning & Land Use,Urban Development & Land Use,Machine Learning,Classification,Measure heterogeneous perception of urban space with massive data and machine learning,SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities),Methodological,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

The concept of “smart cities” aims at utilising advanced technologies, artificial intelligence and high computational capacity to increase their resilience and improve the services provided to the citizens. Computation-based numerical simulations have been essentially used to estimate the effects of explosion events in urban environments in terms of both structural damage and human casualties. These provide urban planners and decision makers with valuable information for vulnerability assessment and aid developing prevention or mitigation solutions. In this article, we present a framework to generate a 3D large-scale urbanistic finite element model, where the desired geospatial data are extracted from the open-source world map OpenStreetMap. The model is used to simulate blast wave propagation effects in a wide urban area taking into account the reflections at building surfaces via a sophisticated Fluid-Structure interaction technique integrated in the EUROPLEXUS explicit finite element method software. The explosion in the Port of Beirut in Lebanon, which took place on the 4th of August 2020, was remarkable for the large amount of explosive material causing considerable damage to surrounding structures and a high number of deaths and injured. Such characteristics make the event suitable for assessing the performance of the proposed computational approach in a widely exposed (by the blast wave) urban zone. © 2021 The Authors",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100545374,No,China,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, we investigated spatiotemporal patterns of more than 52,000 reported incidents of drug-related crime at block group granularity in Chicago, IL between 2016 and 2019. We applied a space-time analysis framework and machine learning approaches to build a model using training data that identified whether certain locations and built environment and sociodemographic factors were correlated with drug-related crime incident patterns, and establish the top contributing factors that underlaid the trends. Space and time, together with multiple driving factors, were incorporated into a random forest model to analyze these changing patterns. We accommodated both spatial and temporal autocorrelation in the model learning process to assist with capturing the changes over time and tested the capabilities of the space-time random forest model by predicting drug-related activity hot zones.

To this end, we implement the random forest MLA to simulate the intercity corporate networks created by Fortune China 500 firms in mainland China. The random forest MLA does not require a predefined model but detects patterns directly from the data to automatically build models. The city-dyad connectivities were computed using an interlocking network model and treated as target variables. City factors and geographical factors were treated as features. The model was trained using a 2010 training set and subsequently validated using 2010 and 2017 test sets. The results are promising, with the pseudo R2 of the model coupled with different test data ranging from 0.861 to 0.940. Nonetheless, the random forest MLA also faces some challenges in the context of the simulation of intercity networks. We conclude that MLAs are potentially useful for specific applications such as the analysis of network big data, scenario simulation in regional planning, and the detection of driving forces in exploratory research. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",This work was supported by the China Scholarship Council .,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099776195,Yes,India,Infrastructure,Smart City Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Random Forest,Classification,Develop random forest-based indoor localization as IoT service for smart buildings,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Weak

Models are considered as good approaches for having better estimation or understanding of the phenomenon of land use, land cover changes, thoughtful planning, and alteration in better management of cities and villages. Therefore, this study was conducted to analyze and compare the three models of logistic regression, ANNs, and Geo-Mod in predicting the expansion of built-up areas in a 10-year period in Marivan city, Iran. For this purpose, land cover maps at different times were prepared using Landsat data, including the images of the TM sensor of Landsat 5 in 1989, the ETM+ sensor of Landsat 7 in 2000, and the TM sensor of Landsat 5 in 2011. According to the results, during the period from 1989 to 2011, the built-up area of land cover has been multiplied by 2.74 (73.63 ha/year), which is equal to 1296 ha in 2011 compared to 459 ha in 1989. According to the results, logistic regression has been the preferred method in modeling changes to built-up areas among the presented methods. In addition, one of the advantages of logistic regression is to determine the relationship between variables and changes to the built-up areas. Although Geo-Mod yielded poorer results than the other two methods, its advantages of the neighborhood rule and the maximum use of available data should not be disregarded. © 2021, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099034321,Yes,Jordan,Safety/Crime,Security & Safety,Urban Mobility & Transportation,Machine Learning,Classification,Develop machine learning-driven optimization for intrusion detection in smart vehicular networks,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

Machine-type communications (MTC) is a major backbone technology that supports connectivity for the Internet of things (IoT). Cellular networks are known to be cost-effective, with ubiquitous coverage that ease the deployment of MTC. However, cellular networks were originally designed for human-centric services with high-cost devices and ever-increasing rate requirements. In contrast, MTC services need to support low-cost, low-energy, massive number of devices. This poses a number of challenges toward the adaptation of current cellular networks to accommodate MTC. This article gives an overview of the conventional random access (RA) scheme of cellular networks and its variants in the literature. However, without discounting the efforts of optimizing the RA scheme, we show that due to the increased collisions and prohibitive overhead, it falls short to support MTC with reduced latency and guaranteed reliability. Alternatively, we discuss different uplink access techniques that are found promising in tackling massive connectivity while avoiding the shortcomings of the conventional RA. Moreover, we discuss how to utilize different future 5G and beyond technologies to efficiently handle massive MTC while pointing out the promising role of machine learning techniques. © 1986-2012 IEEE.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097126428,Yes,China,Safety/Crime,Security & Safety,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"IoT, AI",Multiple,Research urban anti-terrorism intelligence perception system from IoT perspective,"SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 16 (Governance)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Medium

However, challenges such as security, privacy, trust, scalability, verifiability, and centralization prevent faster adaptations of IoT-driven smart cities. Thus, in this paper, a Trustworthy Privacy-Preserving Secured Framework (TP2SF) for smart cities is presented. This framework includes three modules namely: a trustworthiness module, a two-level privacy module, and an intrusion detection module. In trustworthiness module, address-based blockchain reputation system is designed. In the two-level privacy module, a blockchain based enhanced Proof of Work (ePoW) technique is simultaneously applied with Principal Component analysis (PCA) to transform data into a new reduced shape for preventing inference and poisoning attacks. In the intrusion detection module, an optimized gradient tree boosting system (XGBoost) is deployed. Finally, due to inherited strengths and weaknesses of Fog–Cloud architecture, we present a blockchain-IPFS integrated Fog–Cloud infrastructure namely, CloudBlock and FogBlock to deploy proposed TP2SF framework in smart city. The TP2SF framework is evaluated using two realistic IoT-based datasets, namely ToN-IoT and BoT-IoT. The findings indicate the superiority of TP2SF framework over other state-of-the-art techniques in both nonblockchain and blockchain systems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097103889,Yes,Algeria,Infrastructure,Smart City Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Deep Learning (Distributed),Multiple,Develop distributed deep learning algorithm for analyzing big data in smart cities,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Conceptual/Theoretical,Qualitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

Manually searching for unusual events in these massive video streams is a challenging task, since they occur inconsistently and with low probability in real-world surveillance. In contrast, deep learning-based anomaly detection reduces human labour and its decision making ability is comparatively reliable, thereby ensuring public safety. In this paper, we present an efficient deep features-based intelligent anomaly detection framework that can operate in surveillance networks with reduced time complexity. In the proposed framework, we first extract spatiotemporal features from a series of frames by passing each one to a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The features extracted from the sequence of frames are valuable in capturing anomalous events. We then pass the extracted deep features to multi-layer Bi-directional Long Short-term Memory (BD-LSTM) model, which can accurately classify ongoing anomalous/normal events in complex surveillance scenes of smart cities. We performed extensive experiments on various anomaly detection benchmark datasets to validate the functionality of the proposed framework within complex surveillance scenarios.

These datasets constitute a rich source of information that can be used to extract knowledge useful for municipalities and citizens. In this paper we are interested in exploiting such data to estimate future speed in traffic sensor networks, as accurate predictions have the potential to enhance decision making capabilities of traffic management systems. Building effective speed prediction models in large cities poses important challenges that stem from the complexity of traffic patterns, the number of traffic sensors typically deployed, and the evolving nature of sensor networks. Indeed, sensors are frequently added to monitor new road segments or replaced/removed due to different reasons (e.g., maintenance). Exploiting a large number of sensors for effective speed prediction thus requires smart solutions to collect vast volumes of data and train effective prediction models. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of real-world sensor networks calls for solutions that are resilient not only to changes in traffic behavior, but also to changes in the network structure, where the cold start problem represents an important challenge. We study three different approaches in the context of large and dynamic sensor networks: local, global, and cluster-based. The local approach builds a specific prediction model for each sensor of the network. Conversely, the global approach builds a single prediction model for the whole sensor network. Finally, the cluster-based approach groups sensors into homogeneous clusters and generates a model for each cluster. We provide a large dataset, generated from ∼1.3 billion records collected by up to 272 sensors deployed in Fortaleza, Brazil, and use it to experimentally assess the effectiveness and resilience of prediction models built according to the three aforementioned approaches. The results show that the global and cluster-based approaches provide very accurate prediction models that prove to be robust to changes in traffic behavior and in the structure of sensor networks. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Funding text 1: This work is partially supported by FUNCAP SPU 8789771/ 2017 , UFC-FASTEF 31/2019 , BIGDATAGRAPES (EU H2020 RIA, grant agreement N o̱ 780751 ), MASTER (H2020, MSCA grant agreement 777695 ) and the OK-INSAID (MIUR-PON 2018, grant agreement N o̱ ARS01_00917 ) projects.

However, this application scenario requires a challenging combination of characteristics of gas sensors including small formfactor, low cost, ultralow power consumption, superior sensitivity, and high intelligence. Herein, self-powered integrated nanostructured-gas-sensor (SINGOR) systems and a wirelessly connected SINGOR network are demonstrated here. The room-temperature operated SINGOR system can be self-driven by indoor light with a Si solar cell, and it features ultrahigh sensitivity to H2, formaldehyde, toluene, and acetone with the record low limits of detection (LOD) of 10, 2, 1, and 1 ppb, respectively. Each SINGOR consisting of an array of nanostructured sensors has the capability of gas pattern recognition and classification. Furthermore, multiple SINGOR systems are wirelessly connected as a sensor network, which has successfully demonstrated flammable gas leakage detection and alarm function. They can also achieve gas leakage localization with satisfactory precision when deployed in one single room. These successes promote the development of using nanostructured-gas-sensor network for wide range applications including smart home/building and future smart city. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","This work was supported by the General Research Fund (16309018, 16214619) from the Hong Kong Research Grant Council and Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission (JCYJ20180306174923335), Innovation Technology Fund (ITS/115/18, GHP/014/19SZ), Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Joint Laboratory for Intelligent Micro-Nano Optoelectronic Technology (Project No. 2020B1212030010), HKUST Fund of Nanhai (Grant No. FSNH-18FYTRI01) and Foshan Innovative and Entrepreneurial Research Team Program (2018IT100031).

Land resources and urban ecological environment (such as green space) are threatened to some extent. Thus, it is urgent to plan urban land resources and space reasonably, prevent illegal construction, improve urban living environment, and make the city sustainable, orderly, healthy, and green. With the high-resolution remote sensing image data becoming more and more abundant, accurate building extraction using high-resolution remote sensing images plays an important role in urban planning, urban management, and change detection of urban buildings. Based on the U-Net network model, using the Massachusetts building dataset, this paper explored the network model structure and proposed a network model called FE-Net with ""encoder-feature enhancement-decoder"" structure and ELU activation function. First, the best basic network model called U-Net6 was found by comparing the building extraction results using U-Net5, U-Net6, and U-Net7 with different number of network layers. Based on the U-Net6, the network model of ""U-Net6+ReLU+feature enhancement"" was established by adding the structure of feature enhancement. In order to optimize the activation function, the ReLU activation function was replaced by the ELU activation function, and then the network model called FE-Net (U-Net6+ELU+feature enhancement) was created. The FE-Net network model was compared with the building extraction results from the other two network models (U-Net6+ReLU and U-Net6+ReLU+feature enhancement). Results show that the FE-Net network model had the best building extraction performance. Its relaxed F1-measure reached 97.23%, which was 0.36% and 0.12% higher than the other two network models. Meanwhile, FE-Net also had the highest extraction accuracy compared with other studies using the same dataset of Massachusetts. The FE-Net network model can extract multi-scale buildings better, which can not only extract small-scale buildings accurately, but also roughly and completely extract buildings with irregular shape with relatively less missing and wrong detections. Thus, the FE-Net network model can be used to achieve end-to-end building extraction with a high accuracy. © 2021, Science Press.

Back in the 1970s, Jane Jacobs theorized urban vitality and found that there are four conditions required for the promotion of life in cities: diversity of land use, small block sizes, the mix of economic activities, and concentration of people. To build proxies for those four conditions and ultimately test Jane Jacobs's theory at scale, researchers have had to collect both private and public data from a variety of sources, and that took decades. Here we propose the use of one single source of data, which happens to be publicly available: Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. In particular, since the first two conditions (diversity of land use and small block sizes) are visible to the naked eye from satellite imagery, we tested whether we could automatically extract them with a state-of-the-art deep-learning framework and whether, in the end, the extracted features could predict vitality. In six Italian cities for which we had call data records, we found that our framework is able to explain on average 55% of the variance in urban vitality extracted from those records. © 2021 ACM.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118679942,Yes,Austria,Environment,Environment & Sustainability,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Bi-directional RNN,Prediction/Forecasting,Predict traffic noise using multivariate bi-directional recurrent neural network,"SDG 3 (Health), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

For example, if the intelligent video monitoring system cannot process a large amount of data locally, the data will be uploaded to the cloud. Therefore, how to process data in the cloud without exposing the original data has become an important research topic. We propose a single-server version of somewhat homomorphic encryption cryptosystem based on confused modulo projection theorem named CMP-SWHE, which allows the server to complete blind data processing without seeing the effective information of user data. On the client side, the original data is encrypted by amplification, randomization, and setting confusing redundancy. Operating on the encrypted data on the server side is equivalent to operating on the original data. As an extension, we designed and implemented a blind computing scheme of accelerated version based on batch processing technology to improve efficiency. To make this algorithm easy to use, we also designed and implemented an efficient general blind computing library based on CMP-SWHE. We have applied this library to foreground extraction, optical flow tracking, and object detection with satisfactory results, which are helpful for building smart cities. We also discuss how to extend the algorithm to deep learning applications. Compared with other homomorphic encryption cryptosystems and libraries, the results show that our method has obvious advantages in computing efficiency. Although our algorithm has some tiny errors (10-6) when the data is too large, it is very efficient and practical, especially suitable for blind image and video processing. © 2014 IEEE.","Manuscript received July 22, 2020; accepted August 4, 2020.

However, built environments attenuate GPS signals by reflecting or blocking them resulting in some cases multipath and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) reception. These effects cause range errors that degrade GPS positioning accuracy. Enhancements in the design of antennae and receivers deliver a level of reduction of multipath. However, NLOS signal reception and residual effects of multipath are still to be mitigated sufficiently for improvements in range errors and positioning accuracy. Recent machine learning-based methods have shown promise in improving pseudorange-based position solutions by considering multiple variables from raw GPS measurements. However, positioning accuracy is limited by low accuracy signal reception classification. Unlike the existing methods, which use machine learning to directly predict the signal reception classification, we use a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT)-based method to predict the pseudorange errors by considering the signal strength, satellite elevation angle and pseudorange residuals. With the predicted pseudorange errors, two variations of the algorithm are proposed to improve positioning accuracy. The first corrects pseudorange errors and the other either corrects or excludes the signals determined to contain the effects of multipath and NLOS signals. The results for a challenging urban environment characterized by high-rise buildings on one side, show that the 3-D positioning accuracy of the pseudorange error correction-based positioning measured in terms of the root mean square error is 23.3 m, an improvement of more than 70% over the conventional methods. © 2014 IEEE.","Manuscript received July 15, 2020; revised September 17, 2020 and October 22, 2020; accepted November 6, 2020.

With the reduction in manual work and the adoption of automation, cities are getting more efficient and smarter. However, this evolution also made data even more sensitive, especially in the industrial segment. The latter has caught the attention of many hackers targeting Industrial IoT (IIoT) devices or networks, hence the number of malicious software, i.e., malware, has increased as well. In this article, we present the IIoT concept and applications for smart cities, besides also presenting the security challenges faced by this emerging area. We survey currently available deep learning (DL) techniques for IIoT in smart cities, mainly deep reinforcement learning, recurrent neural networks, and convolutional neural networks, and highlight the advantages and disadvantages of security-related methods. We also present insights, open issues, and future trends applying DL techniques to enhance IIoT security. © 2014 IEEE.","Manuscript received November 21, 2020; accepted November 30, 2020.

Images collected in outdoor hazy environments are prone to color distortion and low contrast; thus, the desired visual effect cannot be achieved and the difficulty of target detection is increased. Artificial intelligence (AI) solutions provide great help for dehazy images, which can automatically identify patterns or monitor the environment. Therefore, we propose a 3D reconstruction method of dehazed images for smart cities based on deep learning. First, we propose a fine transmission image deep convolutional regression network (FT-DCRN) dehazing algorithm that uses fine transmission image and atmospheric light value to compute dehazed image. The DCRN is used to obtain the coarse transmission image, which can not only expand the receptive field of the network but also retain the features to maintain the nonlinearity of the overall network. The fine transmission image is obtained by refining the coarse transmission image using a guided filter. The atmospheric light value is estimated according to the position and brightness of the pixels in the original hazy image. Second, we use the dehazed images generated by the FT-DCRN dehazing algorithm for 3D reconstruction. An advanced relaxed iterative fine matching based on the structure from motion (ARI-SFM) algorithm is proposed. The ARISFM algorithm, which obtains the fine matching corner pairs and reduces the number of iterations, establishes an accurate one-to-one matching corner relationship. The experimental results show that our FT-DCRN dehazing algorithm improves the accuracy compared to other representative algorithms. In addition, the ARI-SFM algorithm guarantees the precision and improves the efficiency. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

Various deep learning models use significant amounts of training data without generalization abilities and with huge time complexity. To overcome these problems, in the current work, we present an efficient light-weight convolutional neural network (CNN)-based anomaly recognition framework that is functional in a surveillance environment with reduced time complexity. We extract spatial CNN features from a series of video frames and feed them to the proposed residual attention-based long short-term memory (LSTM) network, which can precisely recognize anomalous activity in surveillance videos. The representative CNN features with the residual blocks concept in LSTM for sequence learning prove to be effective for anomaly detection and recognition, validating our model’s effective usage in smart cities video surveillance. Extensive experiments on the real-world benchmark UCF-Crime dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed model within complex surveillance environments and demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models with a 1.77%, 0.76%, and 8.62% increase in accuracy on the UCF-Crime, UMN and Avenue datasets, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

A wide range of different solutions relying on this communication technology can be found in the literature: nevertheless, the most part of these architectures focus on single task systems. Conversely, the aim of this paper is to present the architecture of a LoRaWAN infrastructure gathering under the same network different typologies of services within one of the most significant sub-systems of the Smart City ecosystem (i.e., the Smart Waste Management). The proposed architecture exploits the whole range of different LoRaWAN classes, integrating nodes of growing complexity according to the different functions. The lowest level of this architecture is occupied by smart bins that simply collect data about their status. Moving on to upper levels, smart drop-off containers allow the interaction with users as well as the implementation of asynchronous downlink queries. At the top level, Video Surveillance Units (VSUs) are provided with machine learning capabilities for the detection of the presence of fire nearby bins or drop-off containers, thus fully implementing the Edge Computing paradigm.

Every second, the scale of IoT keeps on increasing in various sectors like smart home, smart city, health, smart transportation and so on.

However, most of the existing researches cannot meet these requirements. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal attention based fusion network (ST-AFN), for lane-level precise prediction. This seq2seq model consists of three parts, namely speed process network, spatial encoder, and temporal decoder. In order to exploit the dynamic dependencies among lanes, attention mechanism blocks are embedded in those networks. The application of deep spatial-temporal information matrix results in progresses in term of reliability. Furthermore, a specific ground lane selection method is also proposed to ST-AFN. To evaluate the proposed model, four months of real-world traffic data are collected in Xiaoshan District, Hangzhou, China. Experimental results demonstrate that ST-AFN can achieve more accurate and stable results than the benchmark models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep learning method has been applied to forecast traffic flow at the lane level on urban ground roads instead of expressways or elevated roads. © 2021 Shen et al.

Firstly, the potential textures of surveillance video images were extracted under multi-order double cross (MODC) mode, and the optical flow features of facial expressions were detected in these images. Next, a facial expression recognition model was constructed based on the DeepID convolutional neural network (CNN), and an emotional semantic space was established for the face images in surveillance video.

A robust network topology structure against cyber-attacks is the foundation of highly reliable service quality, especially in next-generation networks or beyond 5G (B5G) networks. Existing methods apply neural networks with deep reinforcement learning methods to advance the network topology. However, the reduction of unique hardware resource constraints and the application of edge intelligent networking capability of terminal nodes are emerging challenges for robustness optimization of IoT with 5G and B5G networks. To address these problems, we design a distributed learning framework utilizing edge intelligence, improving smart terminal nodes' networking capability, which is deployed on ordinary computers instead of specialized hardware such as GPUs. The proposed framework leveraging multi-core CPU and intelligent edge methods decreases the training time and economic cost and takes full advantage of computer resources. Furthermore, the best performing framework considers the distributed communication model of edge computing and optimizes the network topology by taking advantage of smart terminal nodes' contributions. We show that the framework succeeds in various topologies and outperforms compared with other state-of-art algorithms in improving the robustness for IoT topology in smart cities. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","Funding text 1: 61672131 and 61702365), the New Generation of Artificial Intelligence Science, and Technology Major Project of Tianjin (No. 18ZXZNGX00190 and 19ZXZNGX00010).; Funding text 2: Acknowledgment This work is supported by the the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2019YFB1703601), the Joint Funds of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. U2001204), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85106020120,Yes,China,Water,Water & Sanitation,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Deep Neural Network,Prediction/Forecasting,Invert Secchi depth of Dianchi Lake and analyze temporal-spatial variation using deep NN,"SDG 6 (Water), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

Analysis of the modern security threats at the IoT/IIoT, VANET, and WSN inter-device infrastructures demonstrates that the main concern is a set of network security threats targeted at the functional sustainability of smart urban infrastructure, the most common use case of smart networks. As a result of our study, systematization of the existing cybersecurity risk assessment methods has been provided. Expert-based risk assessment and active human participation cannot be provided for the huge, complex, and permanently changing digital environment of the smart city. The methods of scenario analysis and functional analysis are specific to industrial risk management and are hardly adaptable to solving cybersecurity tasks. The statistical risk evaluation methods force us to collect statistical data for the calculation of the security indicators for the self-organizing networks, and the accuracy of this method depends on the number of calculating iterations. In our work, we have proposed a new approach for cybersecurity risk management based on object typing, data mining, and quantitative risk assessment for the smart city infrastructure. The experimental study has shown us that the artificial neural network allows us to automatically, unambiguously, and reasonably assess the cyber risk for various object types in the dynamic digital infrastructures of the smart city. © 2021 by the authors.

A thorough analysis of mobility patterns in urban areas can provide various benefits, such as the prediction of traffic flow and public transportation usage. In particular, based on its exceptional ability to extract patterns from complex large-scale data, embedding based on deep learning is a promising method for analyzing the mobility patterns of urban residents. However, as urban mobility becomes increasingly complex, it becomes difficult to embed patterns into a single vector because of its limited capacity. In this paper, we propose a novel method for analyzing urban mobility based on deep learning. The proposed method involves clustering mobility patterns and embedding them to capture their implicit meaning. Clustering groups mobility patterns based on their spatiotemporal characteristics, and embedding provides meaningful information regarding both individual residents (i.e., personalized mobility) and all residents as a whole, enabling a more effective analysis of mobility patterns. Experiments were performed to predict the successive points of interest (POIs) based on transportation data collected from 1.5 million citizens in a large metropolitan city; the results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves top-1, 3, and 5 accuracies of 73.64%, 88.65%, and 91.54%, respectively, which are much higher than those of the conventional method (59.48%, 75.85%, and 80.1%, respectively). We also demonstrate that the proposed method facilitates the analysis of urban mobility through arithmetic operations between POI vectors. ©: © 2021 Cho, Kim.

The accurate mapping of the RLP dynamics require reliable land price prediction models and data with fine spatial and temporal resolution. With the aid of point of interest (POI) data and nighttime light (NTL) images, this paper attempts to explore the ability of machine learning algorithms (MLAs) to model grid-level RLPs using the case of Wuhan in China. Several land price prediction models were built using five MLAs and various geographic variables. The experimental results show that the extra-trees regression algorithm and the radial basis function-based support vector regression algorithm perform best in Period Ⅰ (2010–2014) and Period Ⅱ (2015–2019), respectively; therefore, they were selected to estimate the RLPs of the grids without observations in the corresponding period. Based on the estimated results, we found that the spatial pattern of the RLP in Wuhan transitioned from monocentric to polycentric between the two periods, and RLPs grew rapidly near newly formed urban subcenters and waterscapes. The relative importance of the predictor variables shows that commercial and educational facilities are important determinants of the RLP distribution in Wuhan; moreover, the relative importance of natural amenities and education facilities increased over time, while that of commercial facilities and public transportation decreased slightly. The case of Wuhan confirms the feasibility of MLAs and openly accessible urban data in modeling fine-scale RLP distributions. Our proposed framework provides a new approach to monitor the urban land price dynamics accurately and closely, which is beneficial for improving the infrastructure layout and achieve smart city growth. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41671518 , Grant No. 41801189 ), Major Project from the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 18ZDA053 ), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities , China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) to Shougeng Hu.

However, existing research lacks a classification analysis of the influence pathways of different GSE on mental health. Meanwhile, the research method is limited to the measurement of the green space ratio (GSR) based on remote sensing data, which ignores people’s real perception of greenspace. This paper aims to further expand the measurement method of GSE, taking Hangzhou, China as an example, and to reveal the influence mechanism of different GSE modes on mental health. We obtained the personal information, mental health, physical activity, and other data of the interviewees through a questionnaire (n = 461). Combined with a remote sensing satellite and the Baidu Street view database, the method of image interpretation and deep learning was used to obtain the GSR, green visual ratio (GVR), and green visual exposure (GVE). The structural equation model is used to analyze the relationship between different variables. The results showed that: (1) GSE has a certain positive effect on mental health; (2) there are differences in the influence mechanism of multiple measures of GSE on mental health-the GVR and GVE measures based on the interaction perspective between human and greenspace make the influence mechanism more complicated, and produce direct and indirect influence paths; and (3) greenspace perception, sense of community, and physical activity can act as mediators, and have indirect effects. Finally, we call for expanding the measurement index and methods of GSE and integrating them into the management and control practices of urban planning to promote the healthy development of communities and even cities. © 2021 by the authors.

Most cities incorporate data acquisition elements from their own systems or those managed by subcontracted companies that can be used to optimise their resources: energy consumption, smart meters, lighting, irrigation water consumption, traffic data, camera images, waste collection, security systems, pol-lution meters, climate data, etc. The city-as-a-platform concept is becoming popular and it is in-creasingly evident that cities must have efficient management systems capable of deploying, for instance, IoT platforms, open data, etc., and of using artificial intelligence intensively. For many cities, data collection is not a problem, but managing and analysing data with the aim of optimising resources and improving the lives of citizens is. This article presents deepint.net, a platform for capturing, integrating, analysing, and creating dashboards, alert systems, optimisation models, etc. This article shows how deepint.net has been used to estimate pedestrian traffic on the streets of Melbourne (Australia) using the XGBoost algorithm. Given the current situation, it is advisable not to transit urban roads when overcrowded, thus, the model proposed in this paper (and implemented with deepint.net) facilitates the identification of areas with less pedestrian traffic. This use case is an example of an efficient crowd management system, implemented and operated via a platform that offers many possibilities for the management of the data collected in smart territories and cities. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the landslide has been a significant environmental hazard problem during the last five years due to extreme torrential rainstorms. For this regard, a geographic information system (GIS) database was established, which contains 170 landslide polygons that occurred during the last five years and ten influencing factors. The database was used for training and validating the ICA-NeuralNet model. The results showed that the integrated model achieves high performance with classification accuracy rates of 82.4% on the training dataset and 78.2% on the testing dataset.

However, the current ratio of ridesplitting in the ridesourcing services is relatively low and its influencing factors remain unrevealed. Therefore, this paper uses a machine learning method, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model, to explore the nonlinear effects of built environment on the ridesplitting ratio of origin–destination pairs (census tract to census tract). The GBDT model also provides the relative importance ranking of all the built environment factors. The results indicate that distance to city center, land use diversity and road density are the key influencing factors of ridesplitting ratio. In addition, the non-linear thresholds of built environment factors are identified based on partial dependence plots, which could provide policy implications for the government and transportation network companies to promote ridesplitting. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant numbers: 52002244, 71774118]; Shanghai Pujiang Program [Grant number: 2020PJC083]; Shanghai Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences [Grant number: 2020EGL019]; and the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality [Grant number: 20692192200].",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102036317,Yes,Germany,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,YOLO (Deep Learning),Object Detection,Develop service function chaining for low-latency object detection in softwarized networks,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Methodological,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

In parallel, urban centres are also expected to grow significantly in the next years, making necessary to implement the adequate mechanisms to tackle such threats, more specifically flooding. This project aims to develop a flood prediction system using a combination of Machine Learning classifiers along with GIS techniques to be used as an effective tool for urban management and resilience planning. This approach can establish sensible factors and risk indices for the occurrence of floods at the city level, which could be instrumental for outlining a long-term strategy for Smart Cities. The most performant Machine Learning model was a Random Forest, with a Matthew's Correlation Coefficient of 0.77 and an Accuracy of 0.96. To support and extend the capabilities of the Machine Learning model, a GIS model was developed to find areas with higher likelihood of being flooded under critical weather conditions. Therefore, hot spots were defined for the entire city given the observed flood history. The scores obtained from the Random Forest model and the Hot Spot analysis were then combined to create a flood risk index. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85101822911,Yes,Sri Lanka,Safety/Crime,Security & Safety,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Conditional GAN,Image Processing,Remove rain streaks from single images using conditional GANs for video surveillance,SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities),Methodological,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

The implementation of non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI), including travel ban, proved to be an effective way for controlling the epidemic spreading, e.g., the ban of inter-city transportation stops transporting virus through passengers between cities. However, travel ban could significantly impact many industries, e.g. tourism and logistics, thus jeopardizing the regional economy. This paper focus on assisting the national or regional government to make dynamic decisions on restricting and recovering intercity multi-modal travel services. Our model can characterize impacts of inter-city traffic on the spread of the COVID-19, as well as on the regional economy. By applying a reinforcement learning approach, we develop an online optimization model to identify the modal-specific travel banning strategy that can balance the epidemic control as well as the negative impacts on regional economy. The numerical study based on a network of multiple cities in China shows that the proposed approach can generate better strategies compared with some existing methods. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",This research is supported by grants from National Key Research and Development Program of China ( 2018YFB1601600 ).,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85101130466,Yes,China,Waste Management,Water & Sanitation,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,ResNet (Deep Learning),Object Detection,Identify vehicle-thrown-waste in real-time traffic surveillance using residual network,"SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

And yet, we cannot disregard the most vulnerable elements in the urban landscape: pedestrians, exposed to higher risks than other road users. Indeed, safe, accessible, and sustainable transport systems in cities are a core target of the UN's 2030 Agenda. Thus, there is an opportunity to apply advanced computational tools to the problem of traffic safety, in regards especially to pedestrians, who have been often overlooked in the past. This paper combines public data sources, large-scale street imagery and computer vision techniques to approach pedestrian and vehicle safety with an automated, relatively simple, and universally-applicable data-processing scheme. The steps involved in this pipeline include the adaptation and training of a Residual Convolutional Neural Network to determine a hazard index for each given urban scene, as well as an interpretability analysis based on image segmentation and class activation mapping on those same images. Combined, the outcome of this computational approach is a fine-grained map of hazard levels across a city, and an heuristic to identify interventions that might simultaneously improve pedestrian and vehicle safety.

To fulfill this requirement, the introduction of information techniques presents an opportunity for the development of smart cities. For instance, an automatic visual inspection can be employed to replace the role of workers in quality management and streamlines automation. Previously, a large amount of machine vision-based algorithms has been presented to address this problem. However, accurate detection of various tiny integrated circuits remains an unresolved issue. To bridged this gap, a novel deep learning-based approach was proposed for instance segmentation in printed circuit board images. By adding the geometric attention-guided mask branch into the fully convolutional one-stage object detector under the framework of Mask R-CNN, it can produce a segmentation mask for each bounding box to enhance the identification accuracy. To evaluate the ability of the proposed approach, the comparison experiments were conducted between state-of-the-art techniques and ours.

Most of the video synopsis techniques are not suitable to address complex situations like changes in illumination, dynamic background, camera jitter, etc. These techniques firmly depend on the preprocessing results of foreground extraction and multiple objects tracking. Further, the optimization process is a vital phase for the decrement of collision rate among moving objects, where the widely used Simulated Annealing (SA) usually suffers from the issue of slow convergence rate with a high computational overhead. Taking these aforementioned facts into account for feature extraction, we formulate a foreground extraction scheme exploring the concept of multi-frame and multi-scale in Generative Adversarial Network (mFS-GANs). Further, an optimization algorithm is proposed through the hybridization of SA and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), named as, HGWOSA to ensure global optimal result with a low computing overhead. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated through extensive simulations and compared with that of the benchmark schemes. The experiments are carried out using some standard surveillance video dataset (ChangeDetection.Net, MIT Surveillance Dataset, and UMN Dataset) and one self-generated surveillance video at IIIT Bhubaneswar. Overall analysis and experimental evaluations demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms the other competing schemes in terms of both the quantitative and qualitative measures.

For hosting services, the edge computing (EC) platform for its low-latency resource provisioning is fully explored. However, the mapping between edge servers (ESs) and services affects the service latency. Meanwhile, the real-time dynamic distribution of resource requirements also impairs the load balance. Therefore, how to optimize the load balance of ESs while meeting the latency-critical requests remains challenging. To deal with the above challenge, in this article, we propose a resource pre-allocation (RPA) method for the social media services with cognitive analytics. Technically, the deep spatiotemporal residual network (ST-ResNet) is employed to complete the cognitive analytics of resource requests. Then based on the analysis results, the optimal resource allocation (ORA) scheme is designed with multiobjective optimization.

In this research, we developed a method based on semantic segmentation processing of street view images to calculate the Green View Index of urban streets, and the Panoramic View Green View Index (PVGVI) is proposed for measuring the visible street-level greenery. We validated the results by comparison with those of manual inspection and the Pyramid Scene Parsing Network method, and found that the proposed method satisfied the accuracy requirements for vegetation detection. In addition, we conducted a case study of street-level greenery using the PVGVI and confirmed that this method can better visualize urban street-level greenery.

For the case study, the municipality of Penedo, located in the State of Alagoas, was selected. Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 images were used to evaluate urban landscape through normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and the land surface temperature (LST). A simple tool that summarizes NDBI and LST changes was proposed - the Change Detection Index (CDI). It was possible to highlight areas where the increase in temperatures is associated with the built area's intensification. Furthermore, the machine learning k-means clustering tool was applied to create groups and analyze the relationship between urbanization and temperature increase, confirming the CDI values and validating this tool. An evident increase in the built area was highlighted by CDI and cluster analysis, indicating a heat island's potential formation at the implantation area of a housing complex in the municipality. The spatial analysis indicates priority areas for intervention by a simple methodology that facilitated dialogue and understanding between stakeholders, associated with a low-cost tool with the potential for reproduction and adaptation, providing indicators to urban studies and decision-makers and handle the lack of monitoring data in small and medium-sized municipalities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","For an intra-urban scale evaluation, samples from each group were detailed based on high-resolution images, NDVI, NDBI, LST, and CDI changes.

The IoT-enabled smart city can greatly benefit people's daily lives, where smartphone is one of the most widely used IoT devices. For example, people can use the phone to check their financial account, store personal data and communicate with peers. Thus it is very important to safeguard the phones from unauthorized access. To complement traditional textual passwords, touch behavioral authentication has attracted much attention while it is still a challenge on how to build a robust scheme in practice. This is because users’ touch actions are often dynamic and hard to model. For this challenge, previous work has proved that touch actions could become consistent when users interact with social networking applications. Motivated by this observation, in this work, we perform a study to investigate users’ touch behavior within Email applications on smartphones (with Email being one of the most important and widely used means in connecting with others).

More sustainable Bike-sharing systems (BSS) have become an indispensable part of the transport offer by world's major metropolis. Like any computerized service system, they generate voluminous and complex data that the use of which is essentially limited to the management and operation of the system. The movements made by system users can provide valuable information on many aspects of urban life including the spatial and temporal dynamics of travel in the city, on the place of the bicycle among other modes of transport, or on the distribution of territorial and social inequalities in geographical space. In this paper, we study the problem of intelligent management of shared bicycle systems. Indeed, the management of these systems faces many optimization problems in its procession. Thus, to improve the BSS user's satisfaction, it's useful to inform the actors/users in this system about the state of bike sharing for a station. For this, we propose an approach that integrates in these systems both the new IoT for smart city technologies and machine learning in order to facilitate the task of management, availability and profitability. In addition, we propose an automatic management system capable of predicting the number of bikes shared per hour, day or month by taking several dynamic parameters.

The urban sprawl theory is the theoretical foundation in this study. Creatively, deep learning and neural networks were combined to propose an algorithm. Afterwards, a theoretical model of urban sprawl growth was built, with urban industrial development as the principal indicator. According to cities’ economic data in the Yangtze River Economic Belt from 2005 to 2019, the model was optimized through data learning to obtain the final measurement system. On this basis, the urban sprawl levels in different regions could be analyzed. Results demonstrate that the model using the FEPA (Financial Time Series - Empirical Mode Decomposition - Principal Component Analysis - Artificial Neural Network) fusion algorithm has higher errors than other models, with an average accuracy of 82.61% and a total evaluation score of 0.778. Compared with the latest urban sprawl analysis models, the proposed model improves the performance by 7.9%, and keeps the hit rate above 70%, which is suitable for the urban sprawl measurement. In addition, the urban spatial pattern of the Yangtze River Economic Belt is always greater than 1, and the entire space is relatively narrow. From 2005 to 2019, the region's urban sprawl degree has increased by more than 50%. In general, the proposed model can well indicate the urban sprawl situation, so it has a significant reference value for research on the urban sprawl measurement system. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",This work was supported by National Social Science Foundation Project “Research on Promoting the High-quality Development of Manufacturing Industry in the Yangtze River Economic Belt” (No. 19BJL061).,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099369706,Yes,China,Environment,Environment & Sustainability,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Machine Learning,Prediction/Forecasting,Model spatial variations in daily PM2.5 and NO2 of Shanghai using machine learning,"SDG 3 (Health), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 13 (Climate)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Longitudinal,Strong

Event-based systems are constructed to process event streams. They cannot natively consume multimedia event types produced by the Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT) generated data to answer multimedia-based user subscriptions. Machine learning-based techniques have enabled rapid progress in solving real-world problems and need to be optimised for the low response time of the multimedia event processing paradigm. In this paper, we describe a classifier construction approach for the training of online classifiers, that can handle dynamic subscriptions with low response time and provide reasonable accuracy for the multimedia event processing. We find that the current object detection methods can be configured dynamically for the construction of classifiers in real-time, by tuning hyperparameters even when training from scratch.

Current facial recognition methods only utilize singular facial images, so accurate features that are highly correlated with facial changes can hardly be extracted. In order to overcome this difficulty and improve facial expression recognition, in this article, we propose a parallel neural network combining texture features, which can be applied in facial expression recognition. This parallel neural network is constructed by convolution neural network, residual network, and capsule network. Additionally, texture analysis is conducted on facial expression images to extract abundant features. Eight texture features are extracted by gray-level co-occurrence matrix and integrated with features of original images. Finally, these integrated features extracted by three kinds of networks are used to classify facial images. Experimental results prove that the proposed approach has a high recognition rate and strong robustness compared to competitive algorithms. Remarkably, our accuracy reaches 98.14%, with an increase of 3.71% in comparison with ResNet, and the F1-score of 0.9801. It is thus verified from this result that the proposed algorithm has many outstanding advantages.

Malware detection is one of the most powerful and effective approaches to guarantee security of Android systems, especially for industrial platform and smart city. Recently, researches using machine learning-based techniques for Android malware detection increased rapidly. Nevertheless, most of the appeared approaches have to perform feature analysis and selection, so-called feature engineering, which is time-consuming and relies on artificial experience. To solve the inefficiency problem of feature engineering, we propose TC-Droid, an automatic framework for Android malware detection based on text classification method.

TC-Droid feeds on the text sequence of APPs analysis reports generated by AndroPyTool, applies a convolutional neural network (CNN) to explore significant information (or knowledge) under original report text, instead of manual feature engineering. In an evaluation with different number of real-world samples, TC-Droid outperforms state-of-the-art model (Drebin) and several classic models (NB, LR, KNN, RF) as well.

To deploy computationally intensive Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices, traditional approaches have relied on either offloading workload to the remote cloud or optimizing computation at the end device locally. However, the cloud-assisted approaches suffer from the unreliable and delay-significant wide-area network, and the local computing approaches are limited by the constrained computing capability. Towards high-performance edge intelligence, the cooperative execution mechanism offers a new paradigm, which has attracted growing research interest recently. In this paper, we propose CoEdge, a distributed DNN computing system that orchestrates cooperative DNN inference over heterogeneous edge devices. CoEdge utilizes available computation and communication resources at the edge and dynamically partitions the DNN inference workload adaptive to devices' computing capabilities and network conditions. Experimental evaluations based on a realistic prototype show that CoEdge outperforms status-quo approaches in saving energy with close inference latency, achieving up to 25.5% 66.9% energy reduction for four widely-adopted CNN models. © 1993-2012 IEEE.","Manuscript received February 25, 2020; revised September 28, 2020; accepted November 18, 2020; approved by IEEE/ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING Editor K.

However, these new methodologies have not incorporated individual heterogeneity in their analysis, even though differences by gender and other sociodemographic characteristics in the perception of safety and other aspects of landscapes and public spaces have been widely studied in social sciences and urban planning in lower scale studies. In the present study, we combine computational and statistical tools to develop a methodological proposal with high scalability and low implementation cost, which helps to identify and measure heterogeneous perception and its correlation to the presence of elements in the landscape. To achieve this, we implement a survey of perception of public spaces, collecting sociodemographic information of respondents. Then, we fit a discrete choice model to quantify perceptions of these spaces using a parametrization of images that jointly considers semantic segmentation and object detection as input. Our results show heterogeneity in the perception of safety in public spaces according to gender and the observer's habitual mobility choices. The model is then applied to the city of Santiago, Chile. This produces a map of safety perception for different types of users. The proposed method and the obtained results can be a relevant input for the design of public spaces and decision making in the urban planning process. © 2020","The authors would like to thank the support and funding provided by ISCI (ANID PIA/BASAL AFB180003), IMFD (ANID - Millennium Science Initiative Program - Code ICN17_002), CEDEUS (ANID FONDAP 15110020) and FONDECYT (project number 1180605).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85098708944,Yes,Russian Federation,Governance,Governance & Society,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,AI (General),Not Specified,Develop sociological modeling of smart city with implementation of UN SDGs,"SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), Multiple SDGs",Conceptual/Theoretical,Qualitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

Advances in machine learning and deep learning technologies make it easier to achieve significant performance in a wide range of domains from city planning and marketing analysis to credit evaluation and identity theft detection. However, it still requires great efforts in selecting efficient learning algorithms and precise model parameters that are deemed confidential in the light of experience. Also worth noting is that there is a fundamental gap between impracticable business requirements and the available value of data reflected. The data holder or data service provider may not have a clear understanding of data interference. The solution to these two problems depends on the capability of predicting the data utility in advance, which raises a fundamental question: to what degree is the data utility predictable? In this work, we present a primary analytical framework for information-theoretic bounds of data utility and utilize the current state-of-the-art and representative algorithms to obtain the achievable lower bounds on a real-world data set. The gap between theoretical upper bounds and achievable lower bounds indicates that the achievable lower bounds can still be optimized for performance. © 2014 IEEE.","Manuscript received November 8, 2019; revised June 8, 2020 and September 20, 2020; accepted October 17, 2020.

Potable water can be compromised due to a myriad of physical, operational, and environmental factors, such as contaminants intrusion into water pipelines, leaching, disinfection byproducts, chemical or microbial permeation, and pollution. The prediction of potable water quality has seldom been researched, while a novel automated model that offers a proactive approach can be developed to promote sustainability-based strategies. This paper elaborates the impacts of the aforementioned factors on the quality of potable water using the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and risk analysis techniques. The ANN model was developed based on historical data obtained from the water distribution networks (WDNs) of the City of El Pedregal, Peru. The data were streamlined and fed to the neural network to be trained. Subsequent to multiple iterations via the scaled conjugate gradient algorithm, the optimized performance was generated and passed to the trained network to forecast the water quality failure in WDNs. The model performance was tested and validated against different statistical error terms and indicators. The mean absolute error and root-mean-squared error in the ANN failure prediction were computed as 0.08 and 0.15, whereas the average validity of the network was generated to be 92%. Based on the trained neural network, the degree of influence of each factor was determined through implementing a sensitivity analysis. It was found that water quality, water pressure, and operational and maintenance practices had the maximum influence on the risk of failure in water infrastructure. Policy makers and managers can benefit from the proposed model since ANN is already trained, by predicting water quality whenever new data become available. Prediction results will indicate the level of risk (low, moderate, high) to the inhabitants, thereby preemptive measures can be taken to avoid any illness or disease outbreak. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","This work is supported by the collaboration of the Universidad Nacional de San Agustín (UNSA) in Arequipa, Peru , Grant/Contract Number: 80522 and Purdue University in Indiana, USA through Discovery Park’s Center for the Environment (C4E).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097077667,Yes,Netherlands,Safety/Crime,Security & Safety,Urban Resilience & Safety,Machine Learning (Cluster Analysis),Clustering,Analyze safe cities dynamics through machine learning cluster analysis,"SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 16 (Governance)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Longitudinal,Strong

The incorporation of smart infrastructure is taken care right from the design phase of smart buildings itself. One of the crucial smart infrastructures in the development of smart buildings and smart cities is indoor localization. Being aware of the location or movement of people within a building can be very useful in several ways like energy management, location aware marketing services etc. and there are so many such IoT services. So the research problem here is to locate people within a building without using any additional infrastructure. Many research proposals have already been made over the last few years with the goal of predicting location in smart buildings but the real challenge lies with the accuracy of predicted location. User privacy and energy efficiency are also major challenges of indoor localization. Here we propose a random forest based machine learning algorithm that concentrates on improving the location accuracy in indoor localization as an IoT service for smart buildings.

By evaluating the street thermal environment of a city alongside an assessment of those communities that are the most vulnerable to the effects of heat, we can prioritise areas in which heat mitigation interventions are most needed. In this paper, we propose a new approach for policy makers to determine where to delegate limited resources for heat mitigation with most effective outcomes for the communities. We use eye-level street panorama images and community profiles to provide a bottom-up, human-centred perspective of the city scale assessment, highlighting the situation of urban tree shade provision throughout the streets in comparison with environmental and social-economic status. The approach leverages multiple sources of spatial data including satellite thermal images, Google street view (GSV) images, land use and demographic census data. A deep learning model was developed to automate the classification of streetscape types and percentages at the street- and eye-view level. The methodology is metrics based and scalable which provides a data driven assessment of heat-related vulnerability. The findings of this study first contribute to sustainable development by developing a method to identify geographical areas or neighbourhoods that require heat mitigation; and enforce policies improving tree shade on routes, as a heat adaptation strategy, which will lead to increasing active travel and produce significant health benefits for residents. The approach can be also used to guide post COVID-19 city planning and design. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Funding text 1: This research was funded by Australian Smart Cities and Suburbs Program-Smart Active Transport—Urban Heat Maps for Bendigo (SCS59435) and the Clean Air and Urban Landscape Hub funded by the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program.

Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have played a significant role in enhancing road safety where vehicles can share road information conditions. However, VANETs share the same security concerns of legacy ad hoc networks. Unlike exiting works, we consider, in this paper, detection a common attack where nodes modify safety message or drop them. Unfortunately, detecting such a type of intrusion is a challenging problem since some packets may be lost or dropped in normal VANET due to congestion without malicious action. To mitigate these concerns, this paper presents a novel scheme for minimizing the invalidity ratio of VANET packets transmissions. In order to detect unusual traffic, the proposed scheme combines evidences from current as well as past behaviour to evaluate the trustworthiness of both data and nodes. A new intrusion detection scheme is accomplished through a four phases, namely, rule-based security filter, Dempster–Shafer adder, node’s history database, and Bayesian learner. The suspicion level of each incoming data is determined based on the extent of its deviation from data reported from trustworthy nodes. Dempster–Shafer’s theory is used to combine multiple evidences and Bayesian learner is adopted to classify each event in VANET into well-behaved or misbehaving event. The proposed solution is validated through extensive simulations.

To address the computation and storage problems of processing traffic flow big data with the centralized model on a traditional mining platform, we propose a distributed long short-term memory weighted model combined with a time window and normal distribution based on a MapReduce parallel processing framework in this paper, named as WND-LSTM. More specifically, under the Hadoop distributed computing platform, a distributed modeling framework of forecasting traffic flow on MapReduce is developed to solve the existing issues of storage and calculation in handling large-scale traffic flow data with the stand-alone learning model. Moreover, a distributed WND-LSTM model is presented on the MapReduce-based distributed modeling framework to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and scalability of short-term TFP. Finally, we forecast the traffic flow on the Sanlihe East Road of Beijing in China using the proposed WND-LSTM model with the real-world taxi trajectory big data. In particular, the extensively experimental results from a case study demonstrate that the MAPE value of WND-LSTM is 88.48%, 65.79%, 70.46%, 68.21%, 66.95%, 68.43%, and 70.41% lower than that of the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), logistical regression (LR), support vector regression (SVR), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), stacked autoencoders (SAEs), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and long short-term memory (LSTM), respectively, and achieves 71.25% accuracy improvement on average. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Funding text 1: This work described in this paper was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 61762020, 61773321 and 61802082), the China Scholarship Council (Grant no. 201808525063), the High-level Innovative Talents Project of Guizhou (Grant no.

However, building objects in remote sensing images have many complex characteristics, such as variable sizes, dense distributions, diverse topological shapes, complex backgrounds, and presence of occlusions and shadows. Traditional building segmentation algorithms are mainly based on manually designed features such as shapes, edges, and shadow features. These features are shallow features of the building target and cannot well express high-level semantic information, resulting in low recognition accuracy. By contrast, deep convolutional networks show excellent performance in pixel-level classification of natural images. Various fully convolutional network based image segmentation models have been continuously proposed. Most of these models use deconvolution or bilinear interpolation after feature extraction. Feature upsampling and pixel-by-pixel classification are used to segment the input image. The deep features of the building are extracted using highly nonlinear mapping and a large amount of data training, which overcomes the shortcomings of traditional algorithms. However, upsampling cannot completely compensate the information loss caused by repeated convolution and pooling operations in the deep convolutional network model. Therefore, the prediction results are relatively rough, such as small target misclassification, inaccurate boundaries, and other issues. In the field of remote sensing, public data sets are few. Training excellent deep convolutional networks is difficult, and the robustness of the network needs to be further improved. Aiming at the above problems, this paper proposes a conditional generative adversarial network (Ra-CGAN) with multilevel channel attention mechanism to segment remote sensing building objects. Method: A generative model with a multilevel channel attention mechanism is first built. The model is based on a coding and decoding structure that solves small target misses by fusing deep semantics and shallow details with attention. Second, a discriminative network is built and used to distinguish whether the input comes from the real label map or the segmentation map generated by the model. The segmentation result (accuracy and smoothness) is improved by correcting the difference between the two maps. The downsampling method without pooling is used in the discriminator to enhance the propagation of the gradient. Finally, the generated model and the discriminant model are alternately confronted for training through the constraint of the conditional variable of the labelled image. Learning the higher-order data distribution characteristics results in more continuity for the target space. The loss function uses a hybrid loss function, which comes from the cross-entropy loss function brought by the generated map and the real label map in the generation mode. The discriminator predicts the generated image as the loss value brought by the real label image. Experiments are performed on the WHU Building Dataset and Satellite Dataset II datasets. The first dataset has a dense building with many types and accurate labels, and can provide comprehensive, representative evaluation capabilities for the model. Another dataset with a higher segmentation difficulty is used to verify the robustness and scalability of the model. The lighting information and background information of the building are more complex than those of the first dataset. The experiment uses the PyTorch deep learning framework. The size of original image and the label image are unified to 512 × 512 pixels for training, the learning rate of Adam is set to 0.000 2, the momentum parameter is 0.5, the batch-size is 12, and the epoch is 200 times. Acceleration is performed using NVIDIA GTX TITAN Xp. Evaluation indicators include intersection over union (IOU), precision, recall, and F<inf>1</inf>-score. Result: Experiments are performed on the WHU Building Dataset and Satellite Dataset II datasets, and the methods are compared with the latest literature. Experimental results show that in the WHU dataset, the segmentation performance of the Ra-CGAN model is substantially improved compared with models without attention mechanism and adversarial training. Space continuity and integrity of the complex building and small building, and smoothness of building edges are considerably improved. Compared with U-Net, IOU value is increased by 3.75%, and F<inf>1</inf>-score is increased by 2.52%. Compared with the second-performance model, IOU value is increased by 1.1%, and F<inf>1</inf>-score is increased by 1.1%. In the Satellite Dataset II, Ra-CGAN obtains more ideal results in terms of target integrity and smoothness than other models, especially in the case of insufficient data samples. Compared with U-Net, IOU value is increased by 7.26%, and F<inf>1</inf>-score is increased by 6.68%. Compared with the second-placed model, IOU value is increased by 1.7% and F<inf>1</inf>-score is increased by 1.6%. Conclusion: A CGAN remote sensing building object segmentation model with multilevel channel attention mechanism, which combines the advantages of multilevel channel attention mechanism generation model and conditional generative adversarial networks, is proposed. Experimental results show that our model is superior to several state-of-the-art segmentation methods. Much more accurate remote sensing building object segmentation results are obtained on different datasets, proving that the model exhibits better robustness and scalability. © 2021, Editorial Office of Journal of Image and Graphics.

Samples were analyzed for Pb and then combined with publicly available data on potential historic Pb sources, soil properties, and household and neighborhood demographic characteristics. This curated data set was then analyzed with statistical and machine-learning techniques to identify the drivers of potential soil Pb exposure risks and to build predictive models. Among all samples, 43% exceeded current guidelines for Pb in residential gardens.

As the first civilian optical satellite with high spatial resolution, Gaofen2 (GF-2) exhibits the remarkable characteristics of sub-meter high spatial resolution and wide coverage. GF2 provides important data support to multiple fields, such as urban environmental monitoring and urban green space information extraction. However, traditional classification methods still encounter many problems. For example, training a method to be an effective classifier for massive data is difficult, and the accuracy of classification results is generally low. The use of massive high-resolution remote sensing images to achieve large-scale rapid and accurate urban green space distribution extraction is an urgent task for urban planning managers. With the rapid development of deep learning technology, full convolutional networks (FCN) provide novel creative possibilities for semantic segmentation and realize pixel-level classification of images in the field of deep learning for the first time. Inspired by the U-Net network structure, we applied an improved U-Net to urban green space classification for the first time and proposed an automatic classification technique for urban green space by using high-resolution remote sensing images. Method: First, we improved the U-Net model to obtain the U-Net+ model. The main structure of U-Net+ is composed of an encoder and a decoder that can achieve end-to-end training. The encoding channel realizes the multi-scale feature recognition of an image through four-time maximum pooling, and the decoding channel restores the position and detailed information of an image through upsampling. The network uses skip connection to realize the fusion of feature information with the same scale at different levels, overcoming accuracy loss caused by upsampling. In addition, we improved the model by adding batch normalization (BN) after each layer of network convolution operation, effectively regulating the input of the network layer and improving model training speed and network generalization capability. To solve the overfitting problem, which is easily produced by the limited sample training set, we added the dropout layer with a 50% probability of dropping neurons after the convolution operation of the fourth and fifth layers of the network. Second, deep learning requires a large amount of label data related to the classification objectives for training. However, existing open-source datasets cannot meet the requirements of the urban green space classification task. Manually establishing an urban green space tag dataset is necessary. We selected three typical urban green space sample areas in Beijing (urban parks, residential areas, and golf courses) as study areas. By combining GF-2 images and Google Earth remote sensing images in summer and winter, we drew all types of urban green space in the study areas through visual interpretation by using ArcGIS. The visual interpretation results are corrected with actual field investigation. Third, random cropping and data augmentation techniques are adopted to expand the dataset, ensuring the randomness of the samples and enhancing the stability of the model while fully utilizing image information. We adopt the Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.000 1. Result: 1) The overall classification accuracy of the U-Net+ model is improved by 1.06% compared with that of the original U-Net. After 40 training epochs, the accuracy of the U-Net+ model reaches a high level, and the loss function realizes rapid convergence. The U-Net+ model effectively prevents overfitting and improves generalization capability. 2) To verify the effectiveness of our method, the classification accuracy of the U-Net+ results is compared with those of three traditional classification methods, namely, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), neural networks (NNs), and support vector machine (SVM), and three semantic segmentation models, i.e., U-Net, SegNet, and DeepLabv3+. Among the seven classification methods, the U-Net+ model achieves the highest overall classification accuracy for urban green space. The seven classification methods are arranged in order of classification accuracy from large to small: U-Net+ (92.73%) > U-Net (91.67%) > SegNet (88.98%) > DeepLabv3+ (87.41%) > SVM (81.32%) > NNs (79.92%) > MLE (77.21%). 3) In the three types of urban green space, evergreen trees have the highest classification accuracy (F<inf>1</inf> = 93.65%), followed by grassland (F<inf>1</inf> = 92.55%) and deciduous trees (F<inf>1</inf> = 86.55%). 4) Deep learning exhibits strong fault-tolerant capability for training samples. By training and learning a large number of label data, it can effectively reduce the impact of errors and improve recognition capability, making it more suitable for urban green space information extraction than traditional remote sensing classification methods. Conclusion: Deep learning urban green space classification methods can fully mine the spectral, textural, and potential feature information of data. Meanwhile, the U-Net+ model proposed in this study can also effectively reduce the salt-and-pepper noise the classification process and realize high-precision pixel-level classification of urban green space. The improved U-Net+ can effectively improve the accuracy of automatic classification of urban green space in high-resolution remote sensing images and provide a new intelligent interpretation method for urban green space classification in the future. © 2021, Editorial Office of Journal of Image and Graphics.

On the other hand, stochastic algorithms have recently shown high proficiency in dealing with this issue. These are the reasons that this study is dedicated to evaluating an innovative hybrid method for predicting the cooling load (CL) in buildings with residential usage. The proposed model is a combination of artificial neural networks and stochastic fractal search (SFS–ANNs). Two benchmark algorithms, namely the grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) and firefly algorithm (FA) are also considered to be compared with the SFS. The non-linear effect of eight independent factors on the CL is analyzed using each model’s optimal structure. Evaluation of the results outlined that all three metaheuristic algorithms (with more than 90% correlation) can adequately optimize the ANN. In this regard, this tool’s prediction error declined by nearly 23%, 18%, and 36% by applying the GOA, FA, and SFS techniques. Moreover, all used accuracy criteria indicated the superiority of the SFS over the benchmark schemes. Therefore, it is inferred that utilizing the SFS along with ANN provides a reliable hybrid model for the early prediction of CL. © 2021 by the authors.

These problems have adversely affected our life quality and health conditions. In this paper, modelling of traffic noise employing deep learning is investigated. The goal is to identify the best machine-learning model for predicting traffic noise from real-life traffic data with multivariate traffic features as input. An extensive study on recurrent neural network (RNN) is performed in this work for modelling time series traffic data, which was collected through an experimental campaign at an inner city roundabout, including both video traffic data and audio data. The preprocessing of the data, namely how to generate the appropriate input and output for deep learning model, is detailed in this paper. A selection of different architectures of RNN, such as many-to-one, many-to-many, encoder– decoder architectures, was investigated. Moreover, gated recurrent unit (GRU) and long short-term memory (LSTM) were further discussed. The results revealed that a multivariate bi-directional GRU model with many-to-many architecture achieved the best performance with both high accuracy and computation efficiency. The trained model could be promising for a future smart city concept; with the proposed model, real-time traffic noise predictions can be potentially feasible using only traffic data collected by different sensors in the city, thanks to the generated big data by smart cities. The forecast of excessive noise exposure can help the regulation and policy makers to make early decisions, in order to mitigate the noise level. © 2021 by the authors.

The proposed models are formulated through synthesizing a multi-layer perceptron network (MLP) with ant lion optimization (ALO), biogeography-based optimization (BBO), the dragonfly algorithm (DA), evolutionary strategy (ES), invasive weed optimization (IWO), and league champion optimization (LCA) hybrid algorithms. Each ensemble is optimized in terms of the operating population.

The comparison was carried out by implementing a ranking system. Based on the obtained overall scores (OSs), the BBO (OS = 36) featured as the most capable optimization technique, followed by ALO (OS = 27) and ES (OS = 20).

However, the complex landscape of open‐pit mining areas severely restricts the classification accuracy. Although deep learning (DL) algorithms have the ability to ex-tract informative features, they require large amounts of sample data. As a result, the design of more interpretable DL models with lower sample demand is highly important. In this study, a novel multi‐level output‐based deep belief network (DBN‐ML) model was developed based on Ziyuan‐3 imagery, which was applied for fine classification in an open‐pit mine area of Wuhan City. First, the last DBN layer was used to output fine‐scale land cover types. Then, one of the front DBN layers outputted the first‐level land cover types. The coarse classification was easier and fewer DBN layers were sufficient. Finally, these two losses were weighted to optimize the DBN‐ML model. As the first‐level class provided a larger amount of additional sample data with no extra cost, the multi-level output strategy enhanced the robustness of the DBN‐ML model. The proposed model pro-duces an overall accuracy of 95.10% and an F1‐score of 95.07%, outperforming some other models. © 2021 by the authors.

It thus is of great significance to investigate the impacts of land use change on habitat quality in the context of rapid urbanization, particularly in developing countries. However, rare studies were conducted to predict the spatiotemporal distribution of habitat quality under multiple future land use scenarios. In this paper, we established a framework by coupling the future land use simulation (FLUS) model with the Intergrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model. We then analyzed the habitat quality change in Dongying City in 2030 under four scenarios: business as usual (BAU), fast cultivated land expansion scenario (FCLE), ecological security scenario (ES) and sustainable development scenario (SD). We found that the land use change in Dongying City, driven by urbanization and agricultural reclamation, was mainly characterized by the transfer of cultivated land, construction land and unused land; the area of unused land was significantly reduced. While the habitat quality in Dongying City showed a degradative trend from 2009 to 2017, it will be improved from 2017 to 2030 under four scenarios. The high‐quality habitat will be mainly distributed in the Yellow River Estuary and coastal areas, and the areas with low‐quality habitat will be concentrated in the central and southern regions. Multi‐scenario analysis shows that the SD will have the highest habitat quality, while the BAU scenario will have the lowest. It is interesting that the ES scenario fails to have the highest capacity to protect habitat quality, which may be related to the excessive saline alkali land. Appropriate reclamation of the unused land is conducive to cultivated land protection and food security, but also improving the habitat quality and giving play to the versatility and multidimensional value of the agricultural landscape. This shows that the SD of comprehensive coordination of urban development, agricultural development and ecological protection is an effective way to maintain the habitat quality and biodiversity. © 2021 by the authors.

As crime incidents are distributed sparsely across space and time, existing deep-learning methods constrained by coarse spatial scale offer only limited values in prediction of crime density. This paper proposes the use of deep inception-residual networks (DIRNet) to conduct fine-grained, theft-related crime prediction based on non-emergency service request data (311 events). Specifically, it outlines the employment of inception units comprising asymmetrical convolution layers to draw low-level spatiotemporal dependencies hidden in crime events and complaint records in the 311 dataset. Afterward, this paper details how residual units can be applied to capture high-level spatiotemporal features from low-level spatiotemporal dependencies for the final prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed DIRNet is evaluated based on theft-related crime data and 311 data in New York City from 2010 to 2015. The results confirm that the DIRNet obtains an average F1 of 71%, which is better than other prediction models. © 2021 by the authors.

The concept of smart cities gains increasing importance in the European Union, a fact that is reflected in the project “European Innovation Partnership on Smart Cities and Communities” of the European Commission. Smart cities are a practical example of how the new energy policies shape the lives of the European Union citizens, trying to improve it. As a consequence, new business models arise in big cities, involving the use of technology for better living conditions. These new, technology-based business models are important, as they improve the life quality of the inhabitants, they reduce the climate change impact, and they contribute as well to job creation in the IT-industry, promoting innovation. They have as well a social impact, as they bring experts from energy policies, business, economics, legal and IT together in order to project a new type of city—the smart city. The research hypothesis of the present article is that there is a high acceptance towards the concept of smart cities at the European Union level and that this concept could be implemented with the help of information technology and of artificial intelligence. This way, legal provisions, economic measures and IT-tools work together in order to create synergy effects for better life quality of the citizens of the European Union. The research hypothesis is analyzed by means of the questionnaire as a qualitative research method and is as well assessed by using case studies (e.g., Austria, Finland, Romania).

A notable problem that has been introduced by the growth of Internet of Things (IoT) deployments across the smart city ecosystem is that the statistical properties of data streams can change over time, resulting in poor prediction performance and ineffective decisions. While concept drift detection methods aim to patch this problem, emerging communication and sensing technologies are generating a massive amount of data, requiring distributed environments to perform computation tasks across smart city administrative domains. In this article, we implement and test a number of state-of-the-art active concept drift detection algorithms for time series analysis within a distributed environment. We use real-world data streams and provide critical analysis of results retrieved. The challenges of implementing concept drift adaptation algorithms, along with their applications in smart cities, are also discussed. © 2021 by the authorsLicensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Funding: This research work has been financially supported by Academy of Finland UrBOT project (323630), by Academy of Finland 6Genesis Flagship (318927), by EU Horizon 2020 project CUTLER: Coastal Urban developmenT through the LEnses of Resiliency, under contract no. 770469 (http: //www.cutler-h2020.eu/ (accessed on 16 January 2021)), by Riitta ja Jorma J.

In addition, IoT platform designers are faced with another set of questions. How can platforms be extended to smoothly integrate new data management functionalities? Currently, data processing related tasks are typically realized by manually developed code and functions which creates difficulties in maintenance and growth. Hence we need to explore other approaches to integration for IoT platforms. In this paper we cover both these aspects: (1) we explore several emerging data management challenges, and (2) we propose an IoT platform integration model that can combine disparate functionalities under one roof. For the first, we focus on the following challenges: sensor data quality, privacy in data streams, machine learning model management, and resource-aware data management. For the second, we propose an information-integration model for IoT platforms. The model revolves around the concept of a Data-Sharing Market where data management functionalities can share and exchange information about their data with other functionalities. In addition, data-sharing markets themselves can be combined into networks of markets where information flows from one market to another, which creates a web of information exchange about data resources.

Although the traditional approach is to deploy such compute-intensive algorithms into the centralized cloud, the recent proliferation of low-cost, AI-powered microcontrollers and consumer devices paves the way for having the intelligence pervasively spread along the cloud-to-things continuum. The take off of such a promising vision may be hurdled by the resource constraints of IoT devices and by the heterogeneity of (mostly proprietary) AI-embedded software and hardware platforms. In this paper, we propose a solution for the AI distributed deployment at the deep edge, which lays its foundation in the IoT virtualization concept. We design a virtualization layer hosted at the network edge that is in charge of the semantic description of AI-embedded IoT devices, and, hence, it can expose as well as augment their cognitive capabilities in order to feed intelligent IoT applications. The proposal has been mainly devised with the twofold aim of (i) relieving the pressure on constrained devices that are solicited by multiple parties interested in accessing their generated data and inference, and (ii) and targeting interoperability among AI-powered platforms.

Considering the cultural and infrastructure variables in different cities, different approaches have been designed for this purpose, but so far, no work has been done in this area in Tehran. Therefore, in this research, a system of hardware and software based on the internet of things was developed that benefited from Global Positioning System (GPS)/Global System for Mobile (GSM) communication to handle automated urban tolls in Tehran, providing rather the precise location of a user's car and toll payments at any given moment. In addition, in this system, considering the cultural issues in the country, the infrastructure in the metropolis of Tehran, and other important municipal issues, the trespass submission system was designed in accordance with existing surveillance cameras and an infrared-based structure was employed to reduce the burden of image processing in order to improve efficiency.

Lake ecological environment can reflect the environmental situation of the region. Secchi depth (SD) can directly reflect the state of lake water quality, and mastering long-term and large-scale lake SD is the key to control and improve the lake water environment. Dianchi Lake, located in the middle of Yunnan Guizhou Plateau, is the sixth largest freshwater lake in China. It is the main water area for irrigation in Kunming area, and it is also the basic condition for urban development. Therefore, Dianchi Lake is chosen as the research area. Because the in-situ monitoring of lake water quality for this study area was started late, there are few historical SD data. So, it is necessary to simulate and estimate SD by remote sensing images. In this paper, deep neural network algorithm was used to invert the SD of Dianchi Lake from January 1, 2001 to December 3 1, 2018 based on in-situ data and MODIS remote sensing images, and explored its spatial-temporal variation characteristics by geospatial analysis. The in-situ data was the daily monitoring values of 10 stations (Baiyukou, Caohai Center, Dianchi South, Duanqiao, Cuanyinshan East, Cuanyinshan West, Cuanyinshan Center, Haikou West, Huiwan Center, and Luojiaying) from 2001 to 2010 and the monthly monitoring values of 2 regions (Caohai and Waihai) from 2018, which was provided by Yunnan Academy of Environmental Sciences; MODIS data was provided by NASA LAADS Web, with daily time resolution and 500 m spatial resolution. The methods used in this paper included Crey Relational Analysis (C R A), Long-Short Term Memory (L S T M), and Theil-Sen slope estimation. In the construction of SD inversion estimation model, the main methods include Correlation Analysis (C), Outlier Processing (O), Denoising Processing (D), and estimation model (COD-LSTM) . The results showed that (1) the inversion model proposed in this paper had better performance (RMSE = 0. 1359, M A E = 0.1134), which can objectively reflect SD status. (2) The analysis of temporal variation characteristics indicated that the SD of Dianchi Lake presented a downward trend with an average comprehensive change rate of - 0.08m/10 a. (3) The analysis of spatial variation characteristics indicated that the rate of decline in the region with higher SD was larger, and the trend in the region with lower SD was relatively stable. The SD near the urban and residential areas was relatively low. Human activities would become an important factor affecting the SD changes in Dianchi Lake, and it was also the main factor causing lake pollution. © 2021 Science Press.

However, redundant and low-utility stations waste public urban space and maintenance costs of DL-PBS vendors. In this article, we propose a Bicycle Station Dynamic Planning (BSDP) system to dynamically provide the optimal bicycle station layout for the DL-PBS network. The BSDP system contains four modules: bicycle drop-off location clustering, bicycle-station graph modeling, bicycle-station location prediction, and bicycle-station layout recommendation. In the bicycle drop-off location clustering module, candidate bicycle stations are clustered from each spatio-temporal subset of the large-scale cycling trajectory records. In the bicycle-station graph modeling module, a weighted digraph model is built based on the clustering results and inferior stations with low station revenue and utility are filtered. Then, graph models across time periods are combined to create a graph sequence model. In the bicycle-station location prediction module, the GGNN model is used to train the graph sequence data and dynamically predict bicycle stations in the next period. In the bicycle-station layout recommendation module, the predicted bicycle stations are fine-tuned according to the government urban management plan, which ensures that the recommended station layout is conducive to city management, vendor revenue, and user convenience. Experiments on actual DL-PBS networks verify the effectiveness, accuracy, and feasibility of the proposed BSDP system. © 2021 ACM.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102792488,No,South Korea,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

An accurate short-term taxi demand prediction model in both spatial and temporal relations can assist a city pre-allocate its resources and facilitate city-scale taxi operation management in a megacity. To address problems similar to the above, in this study, we proposed a multi-zone order demand prediction model to predict short-term taxi order demand in different zones at city-scale. A two-step methodology was developed, including order zone division and multi-zone order prediction. For the zone division step, the K-means++ spatial clustering algorithm was used, and its parameter k was estimated by the between–within proportion index. For the prediction step, six methods (backpropagation neural network, support vector regression, random forest, average fusion-based method, weighted fusion-based method, and k-nearest neighbour fusion-based method) were used for comparison. To demonstrate the performance, three multi-zone weighted accuracy indictors were proposed to evaluate the order prediction ability at city-scale. These models were implemented and validated on real-world taxi order demand data from a three-month consecutive collection in Shenzhen, China. Experiment on the city-scale taxi demand data demonstrated the superior prediction performance of the multi-zone order demand prediction model with the k-nearest neighbour fusion-based method based on the proposed accuracy indicator. © 2021 Li et al.

The topics generated by this proposed algorithm have relatively higher coherence values than those generated by previously used topic detection methods, namely non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), and eigenspace-based fuzzy C-means (EFCM). The 30 main topics that appeared in topic modeling with the DFCM algorithm were classified into six groups (technology, energy, environment, transportation, e-governance, and human capital and welfare) that characterize the six dimensions of smart, sustainable city research. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, we applied the neural network–Markov model to simulate scenarios of future intra-urban-LU expansion in Lusaka city, Zambia. Data derived from remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques including urban-LU maps (from 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015) and selected driver variables, were used to calibrate and validate the model. We then simulated urban-LU expansion for three scenarios (business as usual/status quo, environmental conservation and protection, and strategic urban planning) to explore alternatives for attaining urban sustainability by 2030. The results revealed that Lusaka had experienced rapid urban expansion dominated by informal settlements. Scenario analysis results suggest that a business-as-usual setup is perilous, as it signals an escalating problem of unplanned settlements. The environmental conservation and protection scenario is insufficient, as most of the green spaces and forests have been depleted. The strategic urban planning scenario has the potential for attaining urban sustainability, as it predicts sufficient control of unplanned settlement expansion and protection of green spaces and forests. The study proffers guidance for strategic policy directions and creating a planning vision. © 2021 by the authors.

The development of IoT has a major impact on several application areas such as healthcare, smart city, transportation, etc. The exponential rise in the sensor nodes might result in enhanced energy dissipation. So, the minimization of environmental impact in green media networks is a challenging issue for both researchers and business people. Energy efficiency and security remain crucial in the design of IoT applications. This paper presents a new green energy-efficient routing with DL based anomaly detection (GEER-DLAD) technique for IoT applications. The presented model enables IoT devices to utilize energy effectively in such a way as to increase the network span. The GEER-DLAD technique performs error lossy compression (ELC) technique to lessen the quantity of data communication over the network. In addition, the moth flame swarm optimization (MSO) algorithm is applied for the optimal selection of routes in the network. Besides, DLAD process takes place via the recurrent neural network-long short term memory (RNN-LSTM) model to detect anomalies in the IoT communication networks. A detailed experimental validation process is carried out and the results ensured the betterment of the GEERDLAD model in terms of energy efficiency and detection performance. © 2021 by the authors.

The incorporation of machine learning through the applications of trained models in these scenarios can pose a computational challenge. The softwarization of networks provides opportunities to incorporate computing into the network, increasing flexibility by distributing workloads through offloading from client and edge nodes over in-network nodes to servers. In this article, we present an example for splitting the inference component of the YOLOv2 trained machine learning model between client, network, and service side processing to reduce the overall service latency. Assuming a client has 20% of the server computational resources, we observe a more than 12-fold reduction of service latency when incorporating our service split compared to on-client processing and and an increase in speed of more than 25% compared to performing everything on the server. Our approach is not only applicable to object detection, but can also be applied in a broad variety of machine learning-based applications and services. © 2021 by the authors.

Recent advances in machine learning and deep learning have the capability to detect and localize salient objects in surveillance video streams; however, several practical issues remain unaddressed, such as diverse weather conditions, recording conditions, and motion blur. In this context, image de-raining is an important issue that has been investigated extensively in recent years to provide accurate and quality surveillance in the smart city domain. Existing deep convolutional neural networks have obtained great success in image translation and other computer vision tasks; however, image de-raining is ill posed and has not been addressed in real-time, intelligent video surveillance systems. In this work, we propose to utilize the generative capabilities of recently introduced conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) as an image de-raining approach. We utilize the adversarial loss in GANs that provides an additional component to the loss function, which in turn regulates the final output and helps to yield better results. Experiments on both real and synthetic data show that the proposed method outperforms most of the existing state-of-the-art models in terms of quantitative evaluations and visual appearance. © 2021 by the authors.

In addition to polluting the environment, TWV easily causes injury to sanitation workers responsible for cleaning roads by passing vehicles. However, manual inspection is still the commonest way to recognize such uncivilized behavior in videos with very high time and labor-consuming. In answer to these challenges, we design a novel 20-layer residual network (Nov-ResNet-20) for training the vehicle-thrown-waste identification model (VTWIM). Then, incorporating Nov-ResNet-20, Selective Search, and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), we propose the deep-residual-network-leveraged vehicle-thrown-waste identification method (DRN-VTWI). Our method first splits one video frame into several regions matching suspected objects marked with location boxes via Selective Search. Then, in terms of the VTWIM trained by Nov-ResNet-20 our method identifies the regions containing TWV. Last, our method removes the redundant location boxes for each recognized, vehicle-thrown waste and only keeps the best one. The significance of our work is four-fold: 1) Nov-ResNet-20 has a moderate depth: 6 convolutional layers, 7 residual layers, and in total 20 weight layers. Due to the joint contribution of the residual, batch normalization, dropout, and cross-entropy loss, it is eligible to identify TWV using a small quantity of manually-annotated training samples. 2) Selective Search diversely marks all possible, suspected objects in video frames, whereas NMS keeps the best location box for each recognized vehicle-thrown waste, removing all redundancies. In this way, DRN-VTWI finds potential violations of TWV as many as possible and optimally annotates vehicle-thrown wastes in frames as well. 3) Combining the power of Nov-ResNet-20, Selective Search, and NMS, DRN-VTWI well solves the challenging, intelligent identification of vehicle-thrown wastes for real-time traffic surveillance. Experimental studies conducted on real-time traffic surveillance videos demonstrate the effectiveness as well as superiority of our efforts. © 2000-2011 IEEE.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102473431,Yes,Portugal,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,Machine Learning,Multiple,Review machine learning approaches to bike-sharing systems systematically,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Review/Survey,Qualitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

However, employing these technologies entails the risk of creating new urban problems and/or intensifying the old ones instead of alleviating them. Hence, in a world with immense technological opportunities and at the same time enormous urbanization challenges, it is critical to adopt the principles of responsible urban innovation. These principles assure the delivery of the desired urban outcomes and futures. We contribute to the existing responsible urban innovation discourse by focusing on local government artificial intelligence (AI) systems, providing a literature and practice overview, and a conceptual framework. In this perspective paper, we advocate for the need for balancing the costs, benefits, risks and impacts of developing, adopting, deploying and managing local government AI systems in order to achieve responsible urban innovation. The statements made in this perspective paper are based on a thorough review of the literature, research, developments, trends and applications carefully selected and analyzed by an expert team of investigators. This study provides new insights, develops a conceptual framework and identifies prospective research questions by placing local government AI systems under the microscope through the lens of responsible urban innovation. The presented overview and framework, along with the identified issues and research agenda, offer scholars prospective lines of research and development; where the outcomes of these future studies will help urban policymakers, managers and planners to better understand the crucial role played by local government AI systems in ensuring the achievement of responsible outcomes. © 2021 by the authors.

In 3D urban models, road signs are small but provide valuable information for navigation. However, due to the problems of sliced shape features, blurred texture and high incline angles, road signs cannot be fully reconstructed in oblique photogrammetry, even with state-of-theart algorithms. The poor reconstruction of road signs commonly leads to less informative guidance and unsatisfactory visual appearance. In this paper, we present a pipeline for embedding road sign models based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). First, we present an end-to-end balanced-learning framework for small object detection that takes advantage of the region-based CNN and a data synthesis strategy. Second, under the geometric constraints placed by the bounding boxes, we use the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) to extract the corresponding points on the road signs. Third, we obtain the coarse location of a single road sign by triangulating the corresponding points and refine the location via outlier removal. Least-squares fitting is then applied to the refined point cloud to fit a plane for orientation prediction. Finally, we replace the road signs with computer-aided design models in the 3D urban scene with the predicted location and orientation.

In this framework, we first use NIN and Dilate Convolution to capture local and global features, respectively, and then introduce the graph convolutional network to learn the correlation of features.

Such levels have proven effects on health, such as: sleep disruption, hypertension, heart disease, and hearing loss. In a scenario where the number of people concentrated in cities is increasing, tools are needed to quantify, monitor, characterize, and quantify noise levels.

The CloudIoT not only presents ubiquitous services through IoT nodes but it also provides virtually unlimited resources through services composition. The services composition problem aims to find a set of services among functionally equivalent services with different Quality of Service (QoS) concerning users' constraints. To this aim, previous studies calculate QoS values through service logs without considering the presence of anomalies in the existing QoS values; however, the dynamicity of distributed service environments and communication networks in CloudIoT environments causes anomalies in the QoS values. Therefore, existing approaches fail to model QoS values accurately that leads to service-level agreement (SLA) violation and penalties for service broker. To address this challenge, we propose a scalable anomaly-aware approach (SAIoT) including two main components: the first component models QoS values based on a machine learning anomaly detection technique, to remove the existing abnormal QoS records, and the second component finds a near-optimal composition by using an effective and efficient metaheuristic algorithm. The experimental results based on real-world data sets show that our approach achieves 30.64% of the average improvement in the QoS value of a composite plan with equal or even less price compared to the previous works, such as information theory-based and advertised QoS-based methods. © 2014 IEEE.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85101708119,Yes,Mexico,Infrastructure,Smart City Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"Neural Network, Blockchain",Classification,Develop IoT expert system for smart cities using blockchain and neural networks,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

Enormous land-use/ land-cover (LULC) transformation has been increasing the carbon emissions (CEs) and land surface temperature (LST) around the world. The study aimed to (i) examine the influences of land specific CEs on LST dynamics and (ii) simulate future potential LULC, CEs and LST pattern of Khulna City Corporation. Landsat satellite images of the year 2000, 2010 and 2020 were used to derive LULC, LST and CEs pattern and change. The correlation between land-use indices (NDBI, NDVI, NDWI) and LST was examined to explore the impacts of LULC change on LST. Unplanned urbanization has increased 11.79 Km2(26.10%) buildup areas and 25,268 tons of CEs during 2000–2020. The calculated R2 value indicates the strong positive correlation between CEs and LST. To simulate the future LULC, CEs and LST pattern for the year 2030 and 2040, multi-layer perceptron-Markov chain (MLP-MC)-based artificial neural network model was utilized with the accuracy rate of 94.12%, 99% and 98.48% for LULC, LST and CEs model, respectively.

Coupled with fog and mobile edge computing, 5G can achieve high data rates, enabling complex autonomous smart city services such as the large deployment of self-driving vehicles and large-scale artificial-intelligence-enabled industrial manufacturing. However, to meet the exponentially growing number of connected IoT devices and irregular data and service requests in both low- and high-density locations, the process of enacting traditional cells supported through fixed and costly base stations requires rethought to enable on-demand mobile access points in the form of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for diversified smart city scenarios. This article envisions a 5G network environment that is supported by blockchain-enabled UAVs to meet dynamic user demands with network access supply. The solution enables decentralized service delivery (drones as a service) and routing to and from end users in a reliable and secure manner. Both public and private blockchains are deployed within the UAVs, supported by fog and cloud computing devices and data centers to provide a wide range of complex authenticated service and data availability.

Building integration system consists of all building services working jointly and a single controlling and monitoring system is used to manage all the services within a building. Building integrating system includes the automatic supply of lights, heating and cooling load of HVAC system as someone enters in a room and shutting down of all electricity and services after leaving a room. The concept of energy saving is being widely used in smart cities of the urban areas, particularly in commercial buildings. The consumption of energy in enormous amounts is one of the prime areas of concern for researchers globally. The focus is on buildings as they are the biggest consumers of energy. The analysis of energy consumption pattern of buildings diverts our attention towards the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system which according to studies accounts for maximum energy consumption within buildings. This paper presents Ensemble-based intelligence algorithms to analyze the HVAC data obtained from various sensors for a commercial building. The data consist of 1 year (12 months) cooling tower data. In this research, 2-month data have been considered for the analysis purpose and two Ensemble intelligence algorithms of regression variant were employed. The results show that the proposed research approach is an improved method in the existing domain.

However, there are many barriers to provide an efficient solution for the IoT service deployment underlying innovation SDN/NFV-based technologies. First, though an IoT service can flexibly deploy via virtual network functions (VNFs), a deployment scheme needs to solve the joint routing and resource allocation problem, which becomes more difficult than the traditional centralized cloud/datacenter solution due to distributed resources in the edge-cloud network. In addition, due to uncertain workloads in IoT services, static optimization solutions may not deal with uncompleted knowledge of the entire input, which is often given by assumptions, but unrealistic in current provisioning approaches. Aiming to address these issues, we model an online mechanism for the dynamic IoT service chain deployment to optimize the operational cost in a finite horizon. We propose a JOint Routing and Placement problem for IoT service chain (JORP) that can dynamically scale in/out the number of VNF instances. We then propose a learning method to efficiently solve JORP based on branch-and-bound (BnB). Our proposed learning mechanism can intelligently imitate the branching/pruning actions of BnB, and remove unlikely solutions in the search space based on the deep neural network model to improve the performance. In that respect, we take an intensive simulation that illustrates the promising result of our proposed deep learning method compared to BnB and the greedy baseline in terms of the performance of the algorithm and the operational cost reduction. © 2021 IEEE.","This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada under NSERC Strategic Program #506319-17, held by Prof. Mohamed Cheriet.

Studies have attempted to capture features of air pollutants such as fine particulate matter (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<inf>2</inf>) using land use regression models, but this method overlooks the multi-collinearity of factors, non-linear correlations between factors and air pollutants, and it fails to perform well when processing daily data. However, machine learning is a feasible approach for establishing persuasive intra-urban air pollution daily variation models. In this article, random forest is utilised to establish intra-urban PM<inf>2.5</inf> and NO<inf>2</inf> spatial-temporal variation models and is compared to the traditional land use regression method. Taking the city of Shanghai, China as the case area, 36 station-measured daily records in two and a half years of PM<inf>2.5</inf> and NO<inf>2</inf> concentrations were collected. And over 80 different predictors associated with meteorological and geographical conditions, transportation, community population density, land use and points of interest are used to construct the land use regression and random forest models. Results from the two methods are compared and impacting factors identified. Explained variance (R2) is used to quantify and compare model performance. The final land use regression model explains 49.3% and 42.2% of the spatial variation in ambient PM<inf>2.5</inf> and NO<inf>2</inf>, respectively, whereas the random forest model explains 78.1% and 60.5% of the variance. Regression mappings for unsampled sites on a grid pattern of 1 km × 1 km are also implemented. The random forest model is shown to perform much better than the land use regression model. In general, the findings suggest that the random forest approach offers a robust improvement in predicting performance compared to the land use regression model in estimating daily spatial variations in ambient PM<inf>2.5</inf> and NO<inf>2</inf>. © The Author(s) 2021.","Funding text 1: The authors wish to acknowledge the supports of the Shanghai Environmental Monitoring Center for assistance in data collection processes.

Urban flood mapping and its use in making an urban development plan can reduce flood damages and losses. Constantly producing urban flood hazard maps using models that rely on the availability of detailed hydraulic-hydrological data is a major challenge especially in developing countries. In this study, urban flood hazard map was produced with limited data using three machine learning models: Genetic Algorithm Rule-Set Production, Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Random Forest (RF) and Naïve Bayes for Kermanshah city, Iran. The flood hazard predicting factors used in modeling were: slope, land use, precipitation, distance to river, distance to channel, curve number (CN) and elevation. Flood inventory map was produced based on available reports and field surveys, that 117 flooded points and 163 non-flooded points were identified. Models performance was evaluated based on area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), Kappa statistic and hits and miss analysis. The results show that RF model (AUC-ROC = 99.5%, Kappa = 98%, Accuracy = 90%, Success ratio = 99%, Threat score = 90% and Heidke skill score = 98%) performed better than other models. The results also showed that distance to canal, land use and CN have shown more contribution among others for modeling the flood and precipitation had the least effect among other factors. The findings show that machine learning methods can be a good alternative to distributed models to predict urban flood-prone areas where there are lack of detailed hydraulic and hydrological data. © 2021, Springer Nature B.V.","Funding text 1: This work has been supported by the Jundi-Shapur University of technology (JSU) in context of Graduate Study Program (GSP).

The complex urban road network structure leads to irregular shapes and arrangements of regions, which poses a challenge for capturing the spatio-temporal correlation of demand generated in different regions. In this study, we propose a multi-community spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (MC_STGCN) framework to predict passenger demand at a multi-region level by exploring spatio-temporal correlations among regions. Specifically, the gated recurrent unit (GRU) is applied to encode the temporal correlation in regions into a vector. On the other hand, the spatial correlations among regions are encoded into two graphs through the graph convolutional network (GCN): geographically adjacent graph and functional similarity graph. Then, a prediction module based on the Louvain algorithm is used to accomplish the passenger demand prediction of multi-regions. The two real-world taxi order data collected in Shenzhen City and New York City are used in model validation and comparison. The numerical results show that the MC_STGCN model outperforms both classical time-series prediction methods and deep learning approaches. Moreover, in order to better illustrate the superiority of the proposed model, we further discuss the improvement of prediction performance though spatio-temporal correlation modeling and analyzing, the effectiveness of community detection compared with random classification of regions, and the advantages of regional level prediction compared with grid-based prediction models. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","The research is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.71701215), Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (No. 2020JJ4752), Innovation-Driven Project of Central South University (No.2020CX041), Foundation of Central South University (No.502045002), Science and Innovation Foundation of the Transportation Department in Hunan Province (No.201725), Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China (No.2018M630914 and 2019T120716).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85098999869,Yes,United Kingdom,Safety/Crime,Security & Safety,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"Blockchain, Random Neural Network",Classification,Develop blockchain random neural network for cybersecure IoT and 5G infrastructure,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Weak

To harness the full potential of smart city initiatives, it is vital for policymakers to align citizens with the project objectives. This study comprehensively characterizes and classifies top-down announcements formulated by city developers into six alignment categories (i.e., smart economy, smart people, smart governance, smart mobility, smart environment, and smart living) using natural language processing. The proposed framework consists of five main processes: (1) web scraping-based extraction of announcements of four smart cities – Boston, Helsinki, Seoul, and Taipei, (2) text data preprocessing, (3) latent Dirichlet allocation-based modeling of strategic topics, (4) quantification of inter-topic similarities using Hellinger distance, and (5) comparison of top-down communication trends with real-world levels of urban performance. Through the comparative analysis of top-down communication trends and actual urban performances, the top-down discourses of smart cities were deconstructed as a reflection of wider political programs developed to enhance citizen alignment and urban performances. Furthermore, inter-topic similarities were also quantified to reflect whether communication strategies are multidisciplinary and city-tailored.

The demanding factor in smart city applications is privacy, security, confidentiality, and authenticity, which are considered a prominent factor in smart city infrastructure's data management interface. Hence In this paper, to resolve such issues, Holistic Big Data Integrated Artificial Intelligent Modeling (HBDIAIM) has been proposed to improve the privacy and security aspects of data management interface in various smart city applications. In HBDIAIM, a differential evolutionary algorithm has been incorporated to build adequate security for the confidential data management interface in smart city applications. Furthermore, the Big Data analytics assisted decision privacy scheme has been used in the differential evolutionary algorithm, which improves the scalability and accessibility of the information in a data management interface based on their corresponding storage location. In addition, the Adaptable interference method is designed and developed to optimize the scalability and privacy issues data management interface of various smart city applications.

More than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas, and many cities have already transformed into “smart” digital/virtual hubs. Digital services ensure city life safe without an economy lockout and unemployment. Urban society strives to be safe, sustainable, well-being, and healthy. We set the task to construct a hybrid sociological and technological concept of a smart city with matched solutions, complementary to each other. Our modeling with the elaborated digital architectures and with the bionic solution for ensuring sufficient data governance showed that a smart city in comparison with the traditional city is tightly interconnected inside like a social “organism”.

This paper develops a new analytical framework based on a wealth of empirical data on both safety/security and socio-economic magnetism achievements of many world cities, by combining two comprehensive relevant global urban data bases. The aim of the study is to offer a comparative analysis of the combined safety/security data and socio-economic performance data of 30 global cities, through the use of an advanced sequential cluster dynamics analysis that is (partly) inspired by a novel machine learning approach (using Python software). In this way, cities can be categorized according to their quantitative characteristic features represented by the relevant clusters.

In addition, the long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM/RNN) has been actively utilized for predicting various time series tasks in recent years due to its outstanding ability to learn the feature of sequential time-series data. Although the existing forecasting models were obtained from learning the sequential PVGF data, it is observed that irregular factors made adverse effects on the forecasting results of very-short-term PVGF tasks, thus, the entire forecasting performance was deteriorated. In this regard, multiscale LSTM-based deep learning which is capable for forecasting very-short-term PVGF is proposed for efficient management. The model concatenates on two different scaled LSTM modules to overcome the deterioration that is originated from the irregular factors. Lastly, experimental results present the proposed framework can assist to forecast the tendency of PVGF amount steadily. © 2007-2012 IEEE.","Manuscript received September 15, 2019; revised March 28, 2020 and June 21, 2020; accepted July 1, 2020.

The 3G has opened the gap to fourth-generation (4G). It will be the same for 5G, which will facilitate the path to 6G. The technology 5G provides a high-level infrastructure enabling various technologies such as autonomous cars, artificial intelligence, drone networking, mobile broadband communication, and, most importantly, the Internet of Things (IoT) and the concept of smart cities. We are, therefore, in the middle of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0). However, as new technologies gain traction, networks become increasingly complex and difficult to pin down to keep networks operating at the level prescribed by evolving services. The ultimate goal of 6G is to move from the concept of the Internet of intelligent things to the new idea of the intelligent Internet of intelligent things. This article shows the features and tools of 6G technology that will help meet these traffic needs.

In real-world applications, however, real scenes can be highly complex (e.g., various building structures and shapes, presence of obstacles, and low contrast between buildings and surrounding regions), making automatic building extraction extremely challenging. To conquer this challenge, we propose a novel method called Deep Automatic Building Extraction Network (DABE-Net). It adopts squeeze-and-excitation (SE) operations and the residual recurrent convolutional neural network (RRCNN) to construct building-blocks. Furthermore, an attention mechanism is introduced into the network to improve segmentation accuracy. Specifically, to handle small buildings, we highlight small buildings and develop a multi-scale segmentation loss function. The theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed method is effective in building extraction and outperforms several peer methods on the dataset of Mapping challenge competition. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","The work is partially supported by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) under its AME Programmatic Funding Scheme (Project No. A18A1b0045 ).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097722269,Yes,China,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,Machine Learning,Prediction/Forecasting,Analyze effect of dataset on evaluating urban traffic prediction,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Weak

Smith School of Business, College Park, MD, United States; Trajcevski, Goce, College of Engineering, Ames, IA, United States","With the recent advances in deep learning, data-driven methods have shown compelling performance in various application domains enabling the Smart Cities paradigm. Leveraging spatial–temporal data from multiple sources for (citywide) traffic forecasting is a key to strengthen the smart city management in areas such as urban traffic control, abnormal event detection, etc. Existing approaches of traffic flow prediction mainly rely on the development of various deep neural networks –e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks such as ResNet are used for modeling spatial dependencies among different regions, whereas recurrent neural networks are increasingly implemented for temporal dynamics modeling. Despite their advantages, the existing approaches suffer from limitations of intensive computations, lack of capabilities to properly deal with missing values, and simplistic integration of heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose a novel urban flow prediction framework by generalizing the hidden states of the model with continuous-time dynamics of the latent states using neural ordinary differential equations (ODE). Specifically, we introduce a discretize-then-optimize approach to improve and balance the prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. It not only guarantees the prediction error but also provides high flexibility for decision-makers. Furthermore, we investigate the factors, both intrinsic and extrinsic, that affect the city traffic volume and use separate neural networks to extract and disentangle the influencing factors, which avoids the brute-force data fusion in previous works. Extensive experiments conducted on the real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines, while requiring significantly less memory cost and fewer model parameters. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 62072077 and No. 61602097 ), the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) grants III 1213038 and CNS 1646107 .",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097721555,No,India,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study provides new evidence for the links between body mass index (BMI) and the BE at different geographic scales in a unified framework. Based on a sample of 10,962 individuals across 95 cities in China, this study explores the collective effects of the BE attributes at neighborhood and city levels on BMI using a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) approach. Moreover, whether the relationships between the city-level BE attributes and BMI vary across social groups is revealed. The results indicate that the city-level BE attributes have larger collective effects on BMI than the neighborhood-level BE attributes. Specifically, population size is the greatest contributor to predicting BMI, with a relative importance of 13.92% among all influential factors. Moreover, it is found that the effects of city-level BE attributes vary across different social groups. These findings suggest it is of vital importance for urban planners to coordinate both neighborhood- and city-level BE planning to deter the risks of obesity, and urban planning can be more effective if it is implemented considering local socio-demographic characteristics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 71621001 , 52072025 ].",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097457860,Yes,India,Safety/Crime,Security & Safety,Urban Mobility & Transportation,"Blockchain, AI/ML",Classification,Develop blockchain-based batch authentication protocol for Internet of Vehicles,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

Pervasive computing over the IoT platform makes life more convenient by embedding sensors based on context-aware computing devices in the physical environment for the ubiquitous availability of computing resources. The sensors gather contextual information from the physical world and transmit it to receivers as per requirements or in case of environmental changes, such as temperature and humidity. However, the combination of dynamic operation and the need to handle sensitive and private data make the pervasive computing environment and IoT devices vulnerable to numerous attacks. Smart environments require a maximum level of safety assurance, such as trusted context producers and customers, which should protect sensitive information from exposure or monitoring. This paper discusses the major cyber threats in smart environments and proposes a novel lightweight security framework that authenticates and maintains the context providers and receivers. The cloud environment is adopted for user authentication at the user layer to implement access control and role assignment. Finally, the proposed security framework is implemented in the IBM cloud platform with six devices to evaluate its efficiency, sustainability, and secure communication. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Funding text 1: The authors extend their appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at the King Saud University for funding this work through research group no ( RG-1439-022 ).; Funding text 2: The authors extend their appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at the King Saud University for funding this work through research group no (RG-1439-022).

These applications prefer high-resolution (HR) IR images since HR IR images benefit the performance. However, HR IR imaging devices are extremely expensive. To save the cost of upgrading imaging devices, an iterative error reconstruction network (IERN) is proposed to improve the resolution of IR images. We first achieve efficient dense connections based on linearly compressive skip links. Slightly sacrificing the performance, the efficient dense connections can markedly reduce the parameters and computations of the vanilla dense connections. Then, an iterative error reconstruction mechanism is proposed to boost the performance, which enables IERN to restore many more textures and edges. Specifically, an initial SR image, high-level features, and up-sampled features are obtained firstly. Secondly, a SR error image is acquired by reconstructing the errors between the initial high-level features and the back-projected features from the up-sampled features. Thirdly, a new SR image is obtained by adding the SR error image to the initial SR image. Iterating the above process, the final SR image is achieved when the number of iterations reaches to the iteration threshold. Experimental results reveal the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",This work is sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 61701327 ).,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85095936552,Yes,China,Safety/Crime,Security & Safety,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Deep Learning,Classification,Develop vehicle re-identification using distance-based global and partial multi-regional feature learning,SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities),Methodological,Quantitative,Regional,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

With the deployment of the fifth generation (5G) mobile communication network, smart city visions of fast, on-demand, intelligent user-specific services are now becoming a reality. The concept of connected IoT is evolving into connected intelligent things. The advancements of both AI techniques, coupled with the sophistication of edge devices, is now leading to a new era of connected intelligence. Moving the intelligence toward end devices must account for latency demands and simplicity of selecting the type of AI technique to be used. Moreover, since most AI techniques require learning from big data sets and reasoning using a multitude of classification patterns, new simplified and collaborative solutions are now necessary more than ever. As such, the concept of introducing decentralized and distributed 'Plug and Play' (PnP) AI tools is now becoming more attractive given the vast numbers in edge devices, data volume and AI techniques. To this end, this article envisions a novel general AI solution that can be adapted to autonomously select the type of machine learning (ML) algorithm, the data set to be used, and provide reasoning in regards to data selection for optimal features extraction. Moreover, the solution performs the necessary training and all the necessary parameter fine-tunings to achieve the highest level of generality and simplicity for AI at the edge.

In the field of urban planning, it is pertinent to understand both how such techniques can advance our understanding of cities, and how they can be embedded within transparent and effective digital planning tools, known as planning support systems. This research specifically focuses on two related contributions. First, it investigates the role of planning support systems in supporting a participatory data analytics approach through an iterative process of developing and evaluating a planning support system environment. Second, it investigates how specifically machine learning planning support systems can be co-designed by built environment practitioners and stakeholders in this environment to solve a real planning issue in Sydney, Australia. This paper presents the results of applied research undertaken through the design and implementation of four workshops, involving 57 participants who were involved in a co-design process. The research follows a mixed-methods approach, studying a wide array of measures related to participatory analytics, task load, perceived added value, recordings and observations. The results highlight recommendations regarding the design and evaluation of planning support system environments for co-design and their coupling with machine learning techniques. It was found that consistency and transparency are highly valued and central to the design of a planning support system in this context. General attitudes towards machine learning and artificial intelligence as techniques for planners and developers were positive, as they were seen as both potentially transformative but also as simply another technique to assist with workflows. Some conceptual challenges were encountered driven by practitioners' simultaneous need for concrete scenarios for accurate predictions, paired with a desire for predictions to drive the development of these scenarios. Insights from this work can inform future planning support system evaluation and co-design studies, in particular those aiming to support democracy enhancement, greater inclusion and more efficient resource allocation through a participatory analytics approach. © The Author(s) 2020.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088359494,Yes,India,Housing,Urban Planning & Land Use,Urban Development & Land Use,Machine Learning,Optimization,Develop novel architecture to identify locations for real estate investment in smart city,SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities),Methodological,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

Whether these accidents can be timely and effectively responded to has been an important indicator to judge whether a region is advanced or not. IoT provide a possibility to solve such emergent problems by intelligent monitoring, diagnosis and repair. For example, coastal cities are often attacked by typhoons, if typhoon meteorological identification and early warning can be effectively carried out, many unnecessary property and personnel losses can be reduced. Accurate typhoon prediction has very important practical significance. However, current typhoon monitoring and prediction are mainly based on simulation with meteorological data; the accuracy still needs to be improved. Nowadays, the technology of Internet of Things (IoT) and remote sensing technology become more and more closely linked; many IoT systems in smart cities’ can obtain high-resolution remote sensing image data. Therefore, it is possible to use urban IoT system to realize the early warning of typhoon. In this paper, we propose a deep learning method for typhoon cloud recognition and typhoon center location, and design a general algorithm framework, including data preprocessing, model training and parameter selection, test and result analysis. Besides, we implement a typhoon early warning demo system. The experimental results show that our algorithm is better than the traditional methods in recognition accuracy. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","The work is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61572157), Grant Nos. 2016A030313660 and 2017A030313365 from Guangdong Province Natural Science Foundation, Shenzhen Municipal Science and Technology Innovation Project, JCYJ20160608161351559, KQJSCX70726103044992, KQJSCX20170327161655607 and JCYJ20170811155158682.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087984291,Yes,Brazil,Environment,Environment & Sustainability,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"IoT, Big Data",Multiple,Develop IoT-based platform for environment data sharing in smart cities,"SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities), SDG 13 (Climate)",Conceptual/Theoretical,Qualitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

But, currently city planners/developers are faced with inadequate contextual information on the dimensions of smart city required to achieve a sustainable society. Therefore, in achieving sustainable society, there is need for stakeholders to make strategic decisions on how to implement smart city initiatives. Besides, it is required to specify the smart city dimensions to be adopted in making cities smarter for sustainability attainment. But, only a few methods such as big data, internet of things, cloud computing, etc. have been employed to support smart city attainment. Thus, this study integrates case-based reasoning (CBR) as an artificial intelligence technique to develop a recommender system towards promoting smart city planning. CBR provides suggestions on smart city dimensions to be adopted by city planners/decision-makers in making cities smarter and sustainable. Accordingly, survey data were collected from 115 respondents to evaluate the applicability of the implemented CBR recommender system in relation to how the system provides best practice recommendations and retaining of smart city initiatives. Results from descriptive and exploratory factor analyses suggest that the developed system is applicable in supporting smart city adoption. Besides, findings from this study are expected to provide valuable insights for practitioners to develop more practical strategies and for researchers to better understand smart city dimensions. © 2020, The Author(s).",Open Access funding provided by NTNU Norwegian University of Science and Technology (incl St. Olavs Hospital - Trondheim University Hospital).

A quick and accurate identification for the location and size of the original fire source is of great scientific and practical value in guiding fire rescue and fighting the tunnel fire. Nevertheless, it is a big challenge to acquire fire-source information in an actual tunnel fire event. In this study, the framework of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data is applied to predict the fire source in a numerical model of the tunnel. A big tunnel fire database of numerical simulations, with varying fire locations, fire sizes, and ventilation conditions, is constructed. Temporally varied temperatures measured by multiple sensor devices are used to train a long-short term memory recurrent neural network. Results demonstrate that the location and size of the tunnel fire and the ventilation wind speed can be predicted by the trained model with an accuracy of 90%. Sensitivity analysis is also carried out to optimize the database configuration and spatial–temporal arrangement of sensors in order to achieve a fast and reliable fire prediction.

Traditional LUR often relies on fixed-site measurements and GIS-derived variables with limited spatial resolution. We present an approach that leverages Google Street View (GSV) imagery to predict street-level particulate air pollution (i.e., black carbon [BC] and particle number [PN] concentrations). We developed empirical models based on mobile monitoring data and features extracted from ~52 500 GSV images using a deep learning model. We tested theory- and data-driven feature selection methods as well as models using images within varying buffer sizes (50-2000 m). Compared to LUR models with traditional variables, our models achieved similar model performance using the street-level predictors while also identifying additional potential hotspots. Adjusted R2 (10-fold CV R2) with integrated feature selection was 0.57-0.64 (0.50-0.57) and 0.65-0.73 (0.61-0.66) for BC and PN models, respectively. Models using only features near the measurement locations (i.e., GSV images within 250 m) explained ~50% of air pollution variability, indicating PN and BC are strongly affected by the street-level built environment. Our results suggest that GSV imagery, processed with computer vision techniques, is a promising data source to develop LUR models with high spatial resolution and consistent predictor variables across administrative boundaries. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant no.

In this work, we consider the paradigm where cloud service providers collect big data from resource-constrained devices for building ML-based prediction models that are then sent back to be run locally on the intermittently connected resource-constrained devices. Our proposed solution comprises an intelligent polynomial-time heuristic that maximizes the level of trust of ML models by selecting and switching between a subset of the ML models from a superset of models in order to maximize the trustworthiness while respecting the given reconfiguration budget/rate and reducing the cloud communication overhead. We evaluate the performance of our proposed heuristic using two case studies. First, we consider Industrial IoT (IIoT) services, and as a proxy for this setting, we use the turbofan engine degradation simulation data set to predict the remaining useful life of an engine. Our results in this setting show that the trust level of the selected models is 0.49%-3.17% less compared to the results obtained using integer linear programming (ILP). Second, we consider smart cities services, and as a proxy of this setting, we use an experimental transportation data set to predict the number of cars.

To effectively improve the pedestrian gender recognition performance, a new method, called cascading scene and viewpoint feature learning (CSVFL), is proposed in this article. The novelty of the proposed CSVFL lies on the joint consideration of two crucial challenges in pedestrian gender recognition, namely, scene and viewpoint variation. For that, the proposed CSVFL starts with the scene transfer (ST) scheme, followed by the viewpoint adaptation (VA) scheme in a cascading manner. Specifically, the ST scheme exploits the key pedestrian segmentation network to extract the key pedestrian masks for the subsequent key pedestrian transfer generative adversarial network, with the goal of encouraging the input pedestrian image to have the similar style to the target scene while preserving the image details of the key pedestrian as much as possible. Afterward, the obtained scene-transferred pedestrian images are fed to train the deep feature learning network with the VA scheme, in which each neuron will be enabled/disabled for different viewpoints depending on whether it has contribution on the corresponding viewpoint.

Multiaccess edge computing (MEC) can enhance the ability of emerging resource-intensive IoT applications and has attracted much attention. However, due to the time-varying network environments, as well as the heterogeneous resources of network devices, it is hard to achieve stable, reliable, and real-time interactions between edge devices and their serving edge servers, especially in the 5G ultradense network (UDN) scenarios. Ultradense edge computing (UDEC) has the potential to fill this gap, especially in the 5G era, but it still faces challenges in its current solutions, such as the lack of: 1) efficient utilization of multiple 5G resources (e.g., computation, communication, storage, and service resources); 2) low overhead offloading decision making and resource allocation strategies; and 3) privacy and security protection schemes. Thus, we first propose an intelligent UDEC (I-UDEC) framework, which integrates blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) into 5G UDEC networks. Then, in order to achieve real-time and low overhead computation offloading decisions and resource allocation strategies, we design a novel two-timescale deep reinforcement learning (2Ts-DRL) approach, consisting of a fast-timescale and a slow-timescale learning process, respectively. The primary objective is to minimize the total offloading delay and network resource usage by jointly optimizing computation offloading, resource allocation, and service caching placement. We also leverage federated learning (FL) to train the 2Ts-DRL model in a distributed manner, aiming to protect the edge devices' data privacy. Simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of both the 2Ts-DRL and FL in the I-UDEC framework and prove that our proposed algorithm can reduce task execution time up to 31.87%. © 2014 IEEE.","Manuscript received April 30, 2020; revised July 22, 2020 and August 8, 2020; accepted September 20, 2020.

UAV path planning deals with finding the most optimal or shortest path for UAVs such that minimum energy and resources are utilized. This paper examines the path planning algorithms for UAVs through a literature survey conducted on 139 systematically retrieved articles published in the last decade that are narrowed down to 36 highly relevant articles. As retrieved from the shortlisted articles, the path planning algorithms include RRT, Artificial Potential, Voronoi, D-Star, A-Star, Dijkstra, MILP, Neural Network, Ant Colony Optimization, and Particle Swarm Optimization that are classified into four main types: Model-based, Conventional, Learning-based, and Cell-based. Most of the disaster-related articles are focused on the post-disaster phase only and use conventional and learning-based algorithms with applications to localize victims and optimize paths. Regarding the UAV communication network (UAVCN), the key challenges are communication issues, resource allocation, UAV deployment, defining UAV trajectory, and content security. UAV path planning's key barriers are path optimization, path completeness, optimality, efficiency, and achieving robustness. Accordingly, a holistic IoT-powered UAV-based smart city management system has been recommended in the current study where all the smart city key components are integrated to address disasters like floods, earthquakes, and bush fire. The proposed holistic system can help prepare for disasters and mitigate them as soon as these arise and help enhance the smart city governance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099627653,Yes,China,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,"RRT, A-Star, Dijkstra, Genetic Algorithm, PSO",Prediction/Forecasting,Develop multiple local 3D CNNs for region-based prediction in smart cities,"SDG 9 (Infrastructure), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)",Methodological,Mixed,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

In particular, urban wetlands are vital habitats for the people and the animals living amongst them. This is because wetlands provide great services, including water filtration, flood and drought mitigation, and recreational spaces. As such, several recent urban development plans are currently needed to monitor these invaluable ecosystems using time- and cost-efficient approaches. Accordingly, this study is designed to provide an initial response to the need of wetland mapping in the City of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), Canada. Specifically, we produce the first high-resolution wetland map of the City of St. John's using advanced machine learning algorithms, very high-resolution satellite imagery, and airborne LiDAR. An object-based random forest algorithm is applied to features extracted from WorldView-4, GeoEye-1, and LiDAR data to characterize five wetland classes, namely bog, fen, marsh, swamp, and open water, within an urban area. An overall accuracy of 91.12% is obtained for discriminating different wetland types and wetland surface water flow connectivity is also produced using LiDAR data. The resulting wetland classification map and the water surface flow map can help elucidate a greater understanding of the way in which wetlands are connected to the city's landscape and ultimately aid to improve wetland-related conservation and management decisions within the City of St. John's. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Funding text 1: This project was undertaken with the financial support of the City of St John's municipality, Newfoundland and Labrador , Canada.

Long-term cost-effective measures for a quiet urban area can be considered at early city planning stages by using the statistical road-traffic noise map. An artificial neural network (ANN) and an ordinary least squares (OLS) model were developed by utilizing data on urban form indicators, based on a 3D urban model and road-traffic noise levels from a normal noise map of city A (Gwangju). The developed ANN and OLS models were applied to city B (Cheongju), and the resultant statistical noise map of city B was compared to an existing normal road-traffic noise map of city B. The urban form indicators that showed multi-collinearity were excluded by the OLS model, and among the remaining urban forms, road-related urban form indicators such as traffic volume and road area density were found to be important variables to predict the road-traffic noise level and to design a quiet city. Comparisons of the statistical ANN and OLS noise maps with the normal noise map showed that the OLS model tends to under-estimate road-traffic noise levels, and the ANN model tends to over-estimate them. © 2021 by the authors.

The cellular automaton (CA) model is the widely applied in simulating urban growth, but the optimum parameters of variables driving urban growth in the model remains to be continued to improve. We propose a novel model integrating an artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) and CA for optimizing parameters of variables in the urban growth model and make a comparison between AFSA-CA and other five models, which is used to study a 40-year urban land growth of Wuhan. We found that the urban growth types from 1995 to 2015 appeared relatively consistent, mainly including infilling, edge-expansion and distant-leap types in Wuhan, which a certain range of urban land growth on the periphery of the central area. Additionally, although the genetic algorithms (GA)-CA model and the AFSA-CA model among the six models due to the distance variables, the parameter value of the GA-CA model is −15.5409 according to the fact that the population (POP) variable should be positively. As a result, the AFSA-CA model regardless of the initial parameter setting is superior to the GA-CA model and the GA-CA model is superior to all the other models. Finally, it is projected that the potentials of urban growth in Wuhan for 2025 and 2035 under three scenarios (natural urban land growth without any restrictions (NULG), sustainable urban land growth with cropland protection and ecological security (SULG), and economic urban land growth with sustainable development and economic development in the core area (EULG)) focus mainly on existing urban land and some new town centers based on AFSA-CA urban growth simulation model.

However, traditional classification or target identification methods are difficult to distinguish different type of buildings from remote sensing images, because the char-acteristics of the environmental landscape around the buildings (like the pixels of the road and parking area) are complex, and it is difficult to define them with simple rules. Convolution neural networks (CNNs) have a strong capacity to mine information from the spatial context and have been used in many tasks of image processing. Here, we developed a novel CNN model named YOLO-S-CIOU, which was improved based on YOLOv3 for specific building detection in two as-pects: 1) module Darknet53 in YOLOv3 was replaced with SRXnet (constructed by superimposing multiple SE-ResNeXt) to significantly improve the feature learning ability of YOLO-S-CIOU while maintaining the similar complexity as YOLOv3; 2) Complete-IoU Loss (CIoU Loss) was used to obtain a better regression for the bounding box. We took the gas station as an example. The ex-perimental results on the self-made gas station dataset (GS dataset) showed YOLO-S-CIOU achieved an average precision (AP) of 97.62%, an F1 score of 97.50%, and had 59,065,366 parame-ters. Compared with YOLOv3, YOLO-S-CIOU reduced the parameters’ number by 2,510,977 (about 4%) and improved the AP by 2.23% and the F1 score by 0.5%. Moreover, in gas stations detection in Tumshuk City and Yanti City, the recall (R) and precision (P) of YOLO-S-CIOU were 50% and 40% higher than those of YOLOv3, respectively.

For this purpose, this study was carried out to measure the carbon carrying capacity, net carbon footprint and net carbon footprint pressure index of Xi’an City, and to characterize the carbon sequestration capacity of Xi’an ecosystem, thereby laying a foundation for developing comprehensive and reasonable low-carbon development measures. This study expects to provide a reference for China to develop a low-carbon economy through Tapio decoupling principle. The decoupling relationship between CO2 and driving factors was explored through Tapio decoupling model. The time-series data was used to calculate the carbon footprint. The auto-encoder in deep learning technology was combined with the parallel algorithm in cloud computing. A general multilayer perceptron neural network realized by a parallel BP learning algorithm was proposed based on Map-Reduce on a cloud computing cluster. A partial least squares (PLS) regression model was constructed to analyze driving factors. The results show that in terms of city size, the variable importance in projection (VIP) output of the urbanization rate has a strong inhibitory effect on carbon footprint growth, and the VIP value of permanent pop-ulation ranks the last; in terms of economic development, the impact of fixed asset investment and added value of the secondary industry on carbon footprint ranks third and fourth. As a result, the marginal effect of carbon footprint is greater than that of economic growth after economic growth reaches a certain stage, revealing that the driving forces and mechanisms can promote the growth of urban space. © 2021 by the authors.

To build a virtual city that are close to a real city, a large number of various types of human models need to be created. To reduce the cost of acquiring models, this paper proposes a method to reconstruct 3D human meshes from single images captured using a normal camera. It presents a method for reconstructing the complete mesh of the human body from a single RGB image and a generative adversarial network consisting of a newly designed shape–pose-based generator (based on deep convolutional neural networks) and an enhanced multi-source discriminator. Using a machine learning approach, the reliance on multiple sensors is reduced and 3D human meshes can be recovered using a single camera, thereby reducing the cost of building smart cities. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 92.1% in body shape recovery; it can also process 34 images per second. The method proposed in this paper approach significantly improves the performance compared with previous state-of-the-art approaches. Given a single view image of various humans, our results can be used to generate various 3D human models, which can facilitate 3D human modeling work to simulate virtual cities. Since our method can also restore the poses of the humans in the image, it is possible to create various human poses by given corresponding images with specific human poses. © 2021 by the authors.

Most of the intelligent systems are composed of prefabricated components. Inappropriate composition of components may lead to unsafe, power-consuming, and vulnerable intelligent systems. Although artificial intelligence-based systems can provide various advantages for humanity, they have several dark sides that can affect our lives. Some terms, such as security, trust, privacy, safety, and fairness, relate to the dark sides of artificial intelligence, which may be inherent to the intelligent systems. Existing solutions either focus on solving a specific problem or consider the some other challenge without addressing the fundamental issues of artificial intelligence. In other words, there is no general framework to conduct a component selection process while considering the dark sides in the literature. Hence, in this paper, we proposed a new framework for the component selection of intelligent systems while considering the dark sides of artificial intelligence. This framework consists of four phases, namely, component analyzing, extracting criteria and weighting, formulating the problem as multiple knapsacks, and finding components. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first component selection framework to deal with the dark sides of artificial intelligence. We also developed a case study for the component selection issue in autonomous vehicles to demonstrate the application of the proposed framework. Six components along with four criteria (i.e., energy consumption, security, privacy, and complexity) were analyzed and weighted by experts via analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. The results clearly show that the appropriate composition of components was selected through the proposed framework for the desired functions. © 2021 by the authors.

However, there is a gap in the literature: currently no unified model for city services has been proposed that can guarantee interoperability across cities, capture each city’s unique characteristics, and act as a base for modeling digital twins. This research aims to fill that gap. In this work, we propose the DT-DNA model in which we design a city services digital twin, with the goal of reflecting the real state of development of a city’s services towards enhancing its citizens’ quality of life (QoL). As it was designed using ISO 37120, one of the leading international standards for city services, the model guarantees interoperability and allows for easy comparison of services within and across cities. In order to test our model, we built DT-DNA sequences of services in both Quebec City and Boston and then used a DNA alignment tool to determine the matching percentage between them. Results show that the DT-DNA sequences of services in both cities are 46.5% identical. Ground truth comparisons show a similar result, which provides a preliminary proof-of-concept for the applicability of the proposed model and framework. These results also imply that one city performs better than the other. Therefore, we propose an algorithm to compare cities based on the proposed DT-DNA and, using Boston and Quebec City as a case study, demonstrate that Boston has better services towards enhancing QoL for its citizens. © 2021 by the authors.

With the development of the deep learning framework, various artificial intelligence services are emerging. In particular, Smart City, which has recently become a hot topic, provides artificial intelligence services based on various data from cities. However, most artificial intelligence services have limitations in efficiently using resources only to satisfy the inference accuracy of models using deep learning technology. Even when configuring a web or platform architecture for actual service application, costs for operating various infrastructure technologies from data inflow, pre-processing, model learning, and serving are incurred. In the case of smart city services, operating costs are expected to be large because they are operated based on vast amounts of data. In this study, various architectures are designed for the development, distribution, and management of stable web services equipped with deep learning models, and the performance of the architectures is compared. Performance comparisons were made for a total of four architectures: Embedded function architecture, which is a general function execution method, and Flask API, Fast API, and TFServing architectures, which are REST methods. As a result of the experiment, TFServing showed the best performance in terms of data processing speed, but when considering the types of models and customization that can be mounted, Fast API, which shows sufficient speed, was also shown to be sufficient to develop a stable architecture. © 2021, Korean Institute of Communications and Information Sciences.

It is possible to predict these potential crimes in detail if crime characteristics, such as detailed techniques, targets, and environmental factors affecting the crime’s occurrence, are considered simultaneously. Therefore, this study aims to categorize theft by performing k-modes clustering using crime-related characteristics as variables and to propose an ANN model that predicts the derived categorizations. As the prediction of theft types allows people to estimate the features of the possibly most frequent thefts in random areas in advance, it enables the efficient deployment of police and the most appropriate tactical measures. Dongjak District was selected as the target area for analysis; thefts in the district showed four types of clusters. Environmental factors, representative elements affecting theft occurrence, were used as input data for a prediction model, while the factors affecting each cluster were derived through multiple linear regression analysis. Based on the results, input variables were selected for the ANN model training per cluster, and the model was implemented to predict theft type based on environmental factors. This study is significant for providing diversity to prediction methods using ANN. © 2021 by the authors.",Funding: This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (No. NRF–2018R1A2B2005528).,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85106509354,Yes,South Korea,Safety/Crime,Security & Safety,Urban Resilience & Safety,Artificial Neural Network,Prediction/Forecasting,Develop ANN model to predict theft types considering environmental factors,"SDG 11, SDG 16",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Longitudinal,Strong

Existing works on natural gas forecasting mostly reply on a combined forecasting model by simply integrating several single-forecasting models. However, due to the existence of redundant single-forecasting models, these works may not attain a higher prediction accuracy. To address the problem, we design a new natural gas load forecasting scheme based on ensemble multilayer perceptron (EMLP) with adaptive weight correction. Our method firstly normalizes multi-source data as original data set, which is further segmented by a window model. Then, the abnormal data is removed and subsequently interpolated to form a complete normalized data set. Furthermore, we integrate a series of multilayer perceptron (MLP) network to construct an ensemble forecasting model. An adaptive weight correction function is introduced to dynamically modify the weight of the previous predicted result. Since the correction function can match well the volatility characteristics of load data, the prediction accuracy is significantly improved. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art load forecasting schemes in terms of the prediction accuracy and stability. © 2021 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

What makes this frustrating is that private companies hold potentially useful data, but it is not accessible by the people who can use it to track poverty, reduce disease, or build urban infrastructure. This project set out to test whether we can transform an openly available dataset (Twitter) into a resource for urban planning and development. We test our hypothesis by creating road traffic crash location data, which is scarce in most resource-poor environments but essential for addressing the number one cause of mortality for children over five and young adults. The research project scraped 874,588 traffic related tweets in Nairobi, Kenya, applied a machine learning model to capture the occurrence of a crash, and developed an improved geoparsing algorithm to identify its location. We geolocate 32,991 crash reports in Twitter for 2012–2020 and cluster them into 22,872 unique crashes during this period. For a subset of crashes reported on Twitter, a motorcycle delivery service was dispatched in real-time to verify the crash and its location; the results show 92% accuracy. To our knowledge this is the first geolocated dataset of crashes for the city and allowed us to produce the first crash map for Nairobi. Using a spatial clustering algorithm, we are able to locate portions of the road network (<1%) where 50% of the crashes identified occurred. Even with limitations in the representativeness of the data, the results can provide urban planners with useful information that can be used to target road safety improvements where resources are limited. The work shows how twitter data might be used to create other types of essential data for urban planning in resource poor environments. © 2021 Milusheva et al.

This research employed a neural network as an adaptive artificially-intelligent application to study the complex domains of traffic vulnerability and the resilience of the transport system in Nigerian cities (Kano and Lagos). The input criteria to train and check the models for the neural resilience network are the demographic variables, the geospatial data, traffic parameters, and infrastructure inventories. The training targets were set as congestion elements (traffic volume, saturation degree and congestion indices), which are in line with the rele-vant design standards obtained from the literature. A multi-layer feed-forward and back-propaga-tion model involving input–output and curve fitting (nftool) in the MATLAB R2019b software wiz-ard was used. Three algorithms—including Levenberg–Marquardt (LM), Bayesian Regularization (BR), and a Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG)—were selected for the simulation. LM converged eas-ily with the Mean Squared Error (MSE) (2.675 × 10-3) and regression coefficient (R) (1.0) for the city of Lagos. Furthermore, the LM algorithm provided a better fit for the model training and for the overall validation of the Kano network analysis with MSE (4.424 × 10-1) and R (1.0).

Present research on IoT mainly focus on the processing of scalar sensor data events and barely considers the challenges posed by multimedia based events. In this paper, we systematically review the existing solutions available for the Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT) by analyzing sensing, networking, service, and application-level services provided by IoT. We present state-of-the-art event-based middleware methods and their suitability for multimedia event processing methods. We observe that existing IoT event-based middleware solutions focus on structured (scalar) events and possess only domain-specific characteristics for unstructured (multimedia) events. A case study for object detection is also presented to demonstrate the requirements associated with the processing of multimedia events within smart cities, even with common image recognition based applications. In order to validate the existing issues in the detection of objects, we also presented an evaluation of object detection models using existing datasets. At the end of each section, we shed light on trends, gaps, and possible solutions based on our analysis, experiments, and review of the existing research. Finally, we summarize the challenges and future research directions for the generalized multimedia event processing (by taking detection of each and every object as an example) based on applications using IoMT. Our experiments demonstrate that existing models are very slow to respond to any unseen class, and existing rich datasets do not have a sufficient number of classes to meet the requirements of real-time applications of smart cities. We show that although there is a significantly large technical literature on IoT, and research on IoMT is also quite actively growing, there have not been much research efforts directed towards the processing of multimedia events. As an example, although deep learning techniques have been shown to achieve impressive performance in applications like image recognition, the methods are deficient in detecting new (previously unseen) objects for multimedia based applications in smart cities. In light of these facts, it becomes imperative to conduct research on bringing together the abilities of event-based middleware for IoMT, and low response-time based online training and adaptation techniques. © 2020 The Authors","Funding text 1: This publication has emanated from research supported in part by a research grant from Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) under Grant Number SFI/12/RC/2289_P2 , co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund.

Many smart services, deployed according to wearable sensor-based physical activity recognition, have been able to early detect unhealthy daily behaviors and further medical risks. Numerous approaches have studied shallow handcrafted features coupled with traditional machine learning (ML) techniques, which find it difficult to model real-world activities. In this work, by revealing deep features from deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in fusion with conventional handcrafted features, we learn an intermediate fusion framework of human activity recognition (HAR). According to transforming the raw signal value to pixel intensity value, segmentation data acquired from a multisensor system are encoded to an activity image for deep model learning. Formulated by several novel residual triple convolutional blocks, the proposed DCNN allows extracting multiscale spatiotemporal signal-level and sensor-level correlations simultaneously from the activity image. In the fusion model, the hybrid feature merged from the handcrafted and deep features is learned by a multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Based on several experiments of performance evaluation, our fusion approach for activity recognition has achieved the accuracy over 96.0% on three public benchmark data sets, including Daily and Sport Activities, Daily Life Activities, and RealWorld. Furthermore, the method outperforms several state-of-the-art HAR approaches and demonstrates the superiority of the proposed intermediate fusion model in multisensor systems. © 2014 IEEE.","Manuscript received December 31, 2019; revised April 27, 2020 and June 30, 2020; accepted July 25, 2020.

The re-design of square in cities is important to make the urban squares livable especially for cities with high population density. Innovative solutions about green space design, computer vision and environmental sensing have been implemented, observing experimentally the influence of the public space on people's behaviour. Furthermore, the platform processes data about weather condition, objects detected by image processing algorithms, environmental pollution and occupancy patterns to perform correlation analysis. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been used to predict people occupancy over time, basing on a weather dataset. The platform implements a Decision Support System (DSS) aimed to read the data, and provide guidelines for urban square design optimization. The DSS is constructed by data modeling, data mining and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) tools tailored on the specific case of study. Experimental observations provide insights for a self-adaptive urban square design. Multiple correspondence analysis best fits qualitative and quantitative data obtained from sensors, and highlights people's behaviour in the urban square in correlation with different variables. After a complete overview of factors which can influence the livability of a square and economical/social models are presented different results about citizen behaviour interpretation in function of weather data and attitudes. The proposed framework can be potentially applied for a generic urban square. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Funding text 1: Angelo Maurizio Galiano.

A Chinese city, Wuhan, has been considered the subject and divided into 5184 units, which is a 1201.2 km2 area in central urban space. The result shows that, three types of urban land use type have the highest rooftop photovoltaic potential, which are Continuous Urban area, Discontinuous Dense Urban area and Industrial, commercial, public and education unit. The annual photovoltaic potential of these three land use types have reached 1818.41 GWh/year, 1957.32 GWh/year and 2022.71 GWh/year, and the average photovoltaic power generation per unit area of these three types have reached 11.23 GWh/km2·year, 9.99 GWh/km2·year and 13.07 GWh/km2·year. In addition, these three land use types contributed 71.4% of the city's total rooftop photovoltaic potential. When considering the coordination of roof photovoltaic development and urban planning, these three types of land use should be given priority.

Although Wi-Fi 6 is already in the market designed for IoT applications. New Smart City applications based on Big Data will depend on 5G as a mobile Internet service provider therefore eliminating the need to deploy additional private network infrastructure or mobile networks. The benefits due to the expanded network access and enhanced connectivity between devices also intrinsically increase cybersecurity risks. Cyber attackers will be provided with additional digital targets; in addition, wireless and mobile network including the access channel infrastructure will be shared between independent services. To address these cybersecurity issues, this article presents the Blockchain Random Neural Network for Cybersecurity applications in a holistic digital and physical cybersecurity user and channel authentication methods. The user identity is kept secret as the neural weights codify the user information, although in case of cybersecurity breach, the confidential identity can be mined and the attacker identified. The proposed method therefore enables a decentralized authentication method.

Many studies have combined the gravitational field model (GFM) with the cellular automata (CA) model to analyze the impact of urban spatial interaction on urban agglomerations. However, previous studies have used threshold-based CA models, which cannot ensure that the amount of simulated urban land (an important control variable) of the proposed CA model and contrasting CA models are consistent during experiments. In addition, previous studies have applied only one or two indicators to represent spatial interactions among cities, which cannot fully reflect the urban spatial field intensity levels within city clusters. Furthermore, previous studies have tended to apply simple mining methods (e.g., logistic regression) to mine the transition rules of CA models. These methods cannot explore the complex relationships between urban growth and driving factors (including urban spatial field intensity). This study proposes an integrated gravitational field model (IGFM) by combining comprehensive economic indicators, time-cost distance and information flow intensity to quantify urban spatial field intensity. The random forest (RF) algorithm, a machine learning method with a strong fitting ability, is adopted to mine the complex transition rules of a demand-driven CA model, which the previously developed simple mining methods are unable to accomplish. The use of demand-driven CA ensures the consistency of urban demand between contrasting CAs, which can help generate more rigorous results. The proposed IGFM-RF-CA is applied to simulate urban growth in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration (BTH). The IGFM-RF-CA can achieve high simulation accuracy not only for a whole area but also for most subdistricts, especially in relatively developed cities. We also find that the intensity of information flow in the simulation can significantly improve the performance of the CA model, particularly in small cities located along the periphery of the BTH, which are characterized by relatively low economic development but high Internet popularity. We suggest that some small cities (e.g., Zhangjiakou and Chengde) can promote their development by increasing their Internet popularity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Funding text 1: We really appreciate the anonymous reviewers for their useful comments and suggestions.

A wealth of studies have assessed biotic responses to urbanization in North America and Europe, but there is little empirical evidence that directly links human activities to urban biodiversity in the tropics. Results from a large-scale field study conducted in Nairobi, Kenya, are used to explore the impact of human activities on the biodiversity of wildlife and livestock with which humans co-exist across the city. The structure of sympatric wildlife, livestock and human populations are characterized using unsupervised machine learning, and statistical modelling is used to relate compositional variation in these communities to socio-ecological drivers occurring across the city. By characterizing landscape-scale drivers acting on these interfaces, we demonstrate that socioeconomics, elevation and subsequent changes in habitat have measurable impacts upon the diversity, density and species assemblage of wildlife, livestock and humans. Restructuring of wildlife and livestock assemblages (both in terms of species diversity and composition) has important implications for the emergence of novel diseases at urban interfaces, and we therefore use our results to generate a set of testable hypotheses that explore the influence of urban change on microbial communities. These results provide novel insight into the impact of urbanization on biodiversity in the tropics. An understanding of associations between urban processes and the structure of human and animal populations is required to link urban development to conservation efforts and risks posed by disease emergence to human health, ultimately informing sustainable urban development policy. © 2020 The Authors.

A smart home offers the necessary capabilities to promote efficiency and sustainability to a resident with their healthcare-related, social, and emotional needs. In particular, it provides an opportunity to assess the functional health ability of the elderly or individuals with cognitive impairment in performing daily life activities. This work proposes an approach named Cognitive Assessment of Smart Home Resident (CA-SHR) to measure the ability of smart home residents in executing simple to complex activities of daily living using pre-defined scores assigned by a neuropsychologist. CA-SHR also measures the quality of tasks performed by the participants using supervised classification. Furthermore, CA-SHR provides a temporal feature analysis to estimate if the temporal features help to detect impaired individuals effectively. The goal of this study is to detect cognitively impaired individuals in their early stages. CA-SHR assess the health condition of individuals through significant features and improving the representation of dementia patients. For the classification of individuals into healthy, Mild Cognitive Impaired (MCI), and dementia categories, we use ensemble AdaBoost. This results in improving the reliability of the CA-SHR through the correct assignment of labels to the smart home resident compared with existing techniques. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096830834,Yes,Pakistan,Healthcare/Wellbeing,Health & Well-being,Social Equity & Quality of Life,Machine Learning,Assessment,Develop automated cognitive health assessment in smart homes using machine learning,"SDG 3, SDG 11",Empirical,Quantitative,Individual,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

The IEEE 802.15.4 standard adopts the carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance channel access mechanism, which performs two consecutive clear channel assessment (CCA). However, performing two consecutive CCA may not be suitable for all types of network scenarios in a star topology-enabled wireless sensor networks (WSN). In this article, we develop an optimal CCA channel access mechanism to address the recurrent data transmission and the long acknowledgement wait period which is encountered in two network scenarios considered in a star topology-enabled WSN. To achieve these requirements, the proposed methodology performs five consecutive CCA for successful data transmission without going into the next backoff stage. Initially, an accurate Markov chain model is developed. Later, a set of mathematical expressions are developed for the proposed method. The model is validated using MATLAB 2017a programming tool. Simulation results show that the proposed methodology outperforms the existing CCA approaches in terms of channel collision time, delay, reliability, probability of collision, packet loss rate, and the probability of successful data transmission. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096800712,Yes,India,ICT Infrastructure,Smart City Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,IEEE 802.15.4 MAC,Optimization,Optimize clear channel assessment in IEEE 802.15.4 MAC protocol for IoT,"SDG 9, SDG 11",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Medium

However, a warehouse is a typical unstructured environment, and robotic grasp and manipulation are extremely important for the package, transfer, search, and so on. Currently, the most usual method is to detect the picking or grasping points for some specific end-effector including suction cup, gripper, or robotic hand. The manipulation performance is, therefore, strongly influenced by the visual detector. To tackle this problem, the affordance map has recently been developed. It characterizes the operation possibilities afforded by the operation scene and has been used for several grasp tasks. Nevertheless, the conventional affordance method often fails in complicated environments due to the mistake calculation results. In this article, we develop a novel framework to integrate the interactive exploration with a composite robotic hand for robotic grasping in a complicated environment. The exploration strategy is obtained by a deep reinforcement learning procedure. The developed new composite hand, which integrates the suction cup and grippers, is used to test the merits of the proposed interactive perception method. Experimental results show the proposed method significantly increases the manipulation efficiency and may bring great economic and social and benefits for smart cities. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program under Grant 2018YFB1305102.

The dynamic and chaotic nature of the traffic information makes the accurate forecasting of traffic flow as a challengeable one in ITS. The volume of traffic data increases dramatically. We enter the epoch of big data. Hence, a 1deep architecture is necessary to process, analyze, and inference such a large volume of data. To develop a better traffic flow forecasting model, we proposed an attention-based convolution neural network long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM), a multistep prediction model. The proposed scheme uses the spatial and time-based details of the traffic data, which are extracted using CNN and LSTM networks to improve the model accuracy. The attention-based model helps to identify the near term traffic details such as speed that is very important for predicting the future value of flow. The results show that our attention-based CNN-LSTM prediction model provides better accuracy in terms of prediction during weekdays and weekend days in the case of peak and nonpeak hours also.

This research work focuses on one such application in the field of IoT together with cloud computing. More number of sensors that are deployed in human body is used to collect patient related data such as deviation in body temperature and others which leads to variation in blood cells that turned to be cancerous cells. Main intention of this work is design a cancer prediction system using Internet of Things upon extracting the details of blood results to test whether it is normal or abnormal. In addition to this, encryption is done on the blood results of cancer affected patient and store it in cloud for quick reference through Internet for the doctor or healthcare nurse to handle the patient data secretly. This research work concentrates on enhancing the health care computations and processing. It provides a framework to enhance the performance of the existing health care industry across the globe. As the entire medical data has to be saved in cloud, the traditional medical treatment limitations can be overcome. Encryption and decryption is done using AES algorithm in order to provide authentication and security in handling cancer patients. The main focus is to handle healthcare data effectively for the patient when they are away from the home town since the needed cancer treatment details are stored in cloud.

A complete and accurate traffic dataset can improve the accuracy of traffic prediction and promote the construction of ITS in cities. Most of the existing traffic datasets are collected on highways, and they are only one-way road data. There is little analysis of the impact of weather on traffic prediction, and more traffic auxiliary information is lacking at the same time. The use of such datasets for experiments can lead to inaccurate and unconvincing results, which is of little significance for the study of urban road prediction reference.

Biodiversity loss and degradation of this highly ecologically productive mangrove forest due to climate change will have a tremendous impact on the livelihood of the people living in the deltaic region. The present study was aimed to find out the dynamics of change in different land cover for the greater Sundarban region. The multi-temporal Landsat images were used to understand the dynamics in three decades from 1998 to 2018. The analysis revealed that Sundarban mangrove forest changed very insignificantly. The change between 1998 and 2008 was approximately 1.2%, i.e. around 26.2 km2, and the change between the year 2008 and 2018 was approximately 1.27%, which consists of 28 km2. However, the dynamics of open mangrove forest and dense mangrove forest were found very high. The human habitat and aquaculture were found as the most rapidly expanding land-use type in this landscape. Area under human habitat has increased approximately 80%, i.e. nearly 654 km2 between 1998 and 2018; area under aquaculture has increased approximately 116% (i.e. around 231 km2) between 1998 and 2008. The MLP-Markov Chain based modelling of land-use has shown an overwhelming increase in human habitat in near future. However, being situated in the close vicinity of dense human population of the city Kolkata, the mangrove habitat remained intact, which is largely due to great amount of conservation efforts that have been exercised by the Govt. and the local forest department. The landscape statistical analysis for understanding the ecological dynamics of every land cover types showed that in 2018, the human habitat became second dominant category in this study area. The aquaculture practice for high economic value has pushed down the native agricultural practice in the region. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the support provided by the Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad, India for carrying out the research work.

In the proposed scheme, two types of authentication take place: vehicle to vehicle (V2V) authentication allows a vehicle to authenticate its neighbor vehicles in its cluster, while batch authentication permits a group of cluster vehicles to be authenticated by their RSU. At the end, a group key is established among the vehicles and RSU in their cluster. RSU then gathers securely data from its vehicles and form several transactions including the information of vehicles and its own given information to the cluster member vehicles. The transactions are formed later by the nearby fog server associated with RSU and then by the cloud server to form a complete block. The created blocks are mined by the cloud servers in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) cloud server network through the voting-based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm. The authentic and genuine data of the blockchain are utilized for Big data analytics through AI/ML algorithms. It is shown that the proposed scheme is highly robust against various attacks through formal and informal security analysis, and also through formal security verification tool. A detailed comparative analysis reveals that the proposed scheme achieves superior security and functionality features, and offers comparable storage, communication and computational costs as compared to other existing competing schemes. Finally, the blockchain implementation has been carried out on the proposed scheme to show its effectiveness. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","We thank the anonymous reviewers, the associate editor and the Editor-in-Chief for their valuable feedback on the paper.

The gallery images of vehicles are ranked based on the similarities in the appearance of objects to a vehicle query image. Previous work on vehicle re-identification has mainly focused on global or local analyses of predefined regions of vehicles to classify the vehicle images with a softmax loss function. On the one hand, separate global or predefined local regions of vehicles are often sensitive to perspective and occlusions. On the other hand, the embedding space supervised by the softmax loss function is not sufficiently compact for the object class. To solve these problems, we propose an end-to-end distance-based global and partial multi-regional deep network (DGPM) that combines multi-regional features to identify global and local differences. We exploit a three-branch architecture to learn the global and partial features from coarsely partitioned regions. A global similarity module is introduced to reduce the background information interference in the local branches. Unlike general classification, we design a distance-based classification layer that maintains consistency among criteria for similarity evaluation. Furthermore, we use spatiotemporal vehicle information to improve the vehicle re-identification results when the camera and shooting time are available. Systematic comparative evaluations performed on the large-scale VeRi and VehicleID datasets showed that our approach robustly achieved state-of-the-art performance.

The number of humanitarian relief actions is growing due to the increased frequency of natural and man-made crises. Various streams of research across different disciplines have focused on ICT and AI solutions for enhancing disaster management processes. However, most of the existing research is fragmented without a common vision towards a converging paradigm. Recognizing this, this paper presents the Disaster City Digital Twin as a unifying paradigm. The four main components of the proposed Digital Twin paradigm include: multi-data sensing for data collection, data integration and analytics, multi-actor game-theoretic decision making, and dynamic network analysis.

The number of factors that influence the identification easily runs into a few hundreds (including floor space area, crime in the locality and so on). Existing literature predominantly focuses on the analysis of price trends in a given location. This paper aims to develop a set of tools to compute an optimal location for investment, a problem which has received little attention in the literature (analysis of house price trends has received more attention). In previous work the authors proposed a machine learning approach for computing optimal locations. There are two main issues with the previous work. All real estate factors were assumed to be independent and identically distributed random variables. To address this, in the current paper we propose a network structure to derive the relational inferences between the factors. However, solving the location identification problem using only a network incurs computational burden. Hence, the machine learning layers from the previous work is combined with a network layer for computing an optimal location with proven lower computational cost. A second issue is that the computations are performed on an online database which has inherent privacy risks. The online data, user information and the algorithms can be tampered through privacy breaches. We present a privacy preservation technique to protect the algorithms, and use blockchains to secure the identity of the user. This paper presents solutions to two interesting problems in the analysis of real estate networks: a) to design tools that can identify an optimal location for investment and b) to preserve the privacy of the entire process using privacy preserving techniques and block chains. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074520121,Yes,India,Housing/Real Estate,Urban Planning & Land Use,Urban Development & Land Use,Machine Learning,Identification,Develop novel architecture to identify locations for real estate investment,SDG 11,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Longitudinal,Medium

In this work, we propose a new, machine-learning-based, indirect approach to the problem, i.e. through residential-choice modelling. Especially in urban environments, exposure and vulnerability are highly dynamic risk components, both being shaped by a complex and continuous reorganization and redistribution of assets within the urban space, including the (re-)location of urban dwellers. By modelling residential-choice behaviour in the city of Leipzig, Germany, we seek to examine how exposure and vulnerabilities are shaped by the residential-location-choice process. The proposed approach reveals hot spots and cold spots of residential choice for distinct socioeconomic groups exhibiting heterogeneous preferences. We discuss the relationship between observed patterns and disaster risk through the lens of exposure and vulnerability, as well as links to urban planning, and explore how the proposed methodology may contribute to predicting future trends in exposure, vulnerability, and risk through this analytical focus.

In recent years, computer vision technology has been widely used in intelligent transportation, unmanned driving, robot navigation, intelligent video monitoring, and many other fields. At present, the camera has become the most commonly used sensing equipment in automatic driving and smart cities, generating massive image and video data. We can realize real-time analysis and processing of these data only by relying on computer vision technology. We can detect all kinds of objects in real time and obtain their position and motion states accurately from the image video. However, the actual scene has a very high complexity. Many complex factors interweave together, which poses a great challenge to the visual computing system. At present, computer vision technology is mainly based on the deep learning method through large-scale data-driven mechanisms. Sufficient data are needed due to the heavy dependence of its training algorithm mechanism on datasets. However, collecting and labeling large-scale image data from actual scenes are time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks, and usually, only small-scale and limited diversity of image data can be obtained. For example, Microsoft common objects in context(MS COCO), a popular dataset used for instance segmentation tasks, has a size of about 300 000 and mainly 91 categories. Expressing the complexity of reality and simulate the real situation is difficult. The model trained on the limited dataset will lack practical significance, because the dataset is not large enough to represent the real data distribution and cannot guarantee the effectiveness of practical application. Method The theory of social computing and parallel systems is proposed based on artificial systems, computational experiments, and parallel execution (ACP). The ACP methodology plays an essential role in modeling and control of complex systems. A virtual artificial society is constructed to connect the virtual and the real world through parallel management. On the basis of the existing facts, artificial system is used to model the behavior of complex systems by using advanced computing experiments and then analyze its behavior and interact with reality to obtain a better operating system than reality. To address the bottleneck of deep learning in the field of computer vision, this paper proposes parallel vision, a visual analysis framework based on parallel learning. Parallel vision is an intelligent visual perception framework that is an extension of the ACP methodology into the computer vision field. In the framework of parallel vision, large-scale realistic artificial images can be obtained easily to give support to the vision algorithm with enough well-labeled image data. In this way, the computer can be turned into a ""laboratory"" of computational intelligence. First, the artificial image system simulates the imaging conditions that may appear in the actual image, uses the internal parameters of the system to automatically obtain the annotation information, and obtains the required artificial images. Then, we use the predictive learning method to design the visual perception model, and then we use the computational experiment method to conduct experiments. Various experiments are conducted on a rich supply of image data generated in the artificial image system. Studying the influence of difficult scenes such as complex environmental conditions on the visual perception model is convenient; thus, some uncontrollable factors in practice can be transformed into controllable factors, and the interpretability of the visual model is increased. Finally, we use prescriptive learning method to optimize model parameters. The difficulty of the visual perception model in the actual scene can be used to guide the model training in the artificial scene. We learn and optimize the visual perception model online through virtual-real interaction. This paper also conducted an application case study to preliminarily demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. This case can work over synthetic images with accurate annotations and real images without any labels. The virtual-real interaction guides the model to learn useful information from synthetic data while keeping consistent with real data. We first analyze the data distribution discrepancy from a probabilistic perspective and divide it into image-level and instance-level discrepancies. Then, we design two components to align these discrepancies, i.e., global-level alignment and local-level alignment. Furthermore, a consistency alignment component is proposed to encourage the consistency between the global-level and the local-level alignment components. Result We evaluate the proposed approach on the real Cityscapes dataset by adapting from virtual SYNTHIA(synthetic collection of imagery and annotations), Virtual KITTI(Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute), and VIPER(visual perception benchmark) datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that it achieves significantly better performance than state-of-the-art methods. Conclusion: Parallel vision is an important research direction in the field of visual computing.

An intelligent construction machinery classification (CMC) system thus becomes important to urban security and smart city engineering. Conventional methods are always problematic in one way or another. For instance, the one-dimensional speech features based recognition algorithms are usually less discriminative in the complex urban acoustic environment, and the two-dimensional spectrogram based convolution neural network (CNN) suffers a long model learning time and is less robust to the background noises. To address these deficiencies, a novel CMC system based on new hybrid acoustic features is presented. Two novel acoustic feature extraction methods are developed, where the first explores the concentrations of the Mel-frequency spectrogram (MFS) using the statistics of the binary MFS (SBMS) and the second characterizes the information entropy sequence feature of the binary MFS (IESF) based on the pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN) model. Then, the hybrid features of SBMS/IESF and the Linear Prediction Cepstral Coefficients (LPCC)/Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are further studied. A database consisting of 84,900 acoustic samples from 6 typical construction machines, horns of vehicles and other urban noises is recorded for experiment and performance validation. The comparisons with many state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Manuscript received May 30, 2020; accepted July 9, 2020.

The accurate and effective prediction will provide an important basis for decision-making in smart transportation systems. This paper proposes a new method of traffic flow forecasting based on quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) strategy for intelligent transportation system (ITS). We establish a corresponding model based on the characteristics of the traffic flow data. The genetic simulated annealing algorithm is applied to the quantum particle swarm algorithm to obtain the optimized initial cluster center, and is applied to the parameter optimization of the radial basis neural network prediction model. The function approximation of radial basis neural network is used to obtain the required data. In addition, in order to compare the performance of the algorithms, a comparison study with other related algorithms such as QPSO radial basis function (QPSO-RBF) is also performed. Simulation results show that compared with other algorithms, the proposed algorithm can reduce prediction errors and get better and more stable prediction results. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Funding text 1: Major projects of science and technology for their services in Tianjin, Grant/Award Numbers: 17YFZCGX00360, 16ZXFWGX00010; Training plan of Tianjin University Innovation Team, Grant/Award Numbers: TD12‐5016, TD13‐5025, TD2015‐23; Major projects of science and technology in Tianjin, Grant/Award Number: 15ZXDSGX00050; Tianjin Key Natural Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 18JCZDJC96800; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 61571328 Funding information; Funding text 2: This research work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61571328), Tianjin Key Natural Science Foundation (No. 18JCZDJC96800), Major projects of science and technology in Tianjin (No. 15ZXDSGX00050), Training plan of Tianjin University Innovation Team (No. TD12‐5016, TD13‐5025, TD2015‐23), Major projects of science and technology for their services in Tianjin (No. 16ZXFWGX00010 and No. 17YFZCGX00360).; Funding text 3: This research work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61571328), Tianjin Key Natural Science Foundation (No. 18JCZDJC96800), Major projects of science and technology in Tianjin (No. 15ZXDSGX00050), Training plan of Tianjin University Innovation Team (No. TD12-5016, TD13-5025, TD2015-23), Major projects of science and technology for their services in Tianjin (No. 16ZXFWGX00010 and No. 17YFZCGX00360).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096717988,Yes,China,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,"QPSO, WNN",Prediction/Forecasting,Develop traffic flow forecasting using quantum particle swarm optimization,SDG 11,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Medium

Ecological environment and socioeconomic drivers have a significant effect on the rapid spread of DF. This study aimed to investigate the long-term relationship between the ecological environment and socioeconomic drivers with DF transmission in the dengue-pandemic city of Guangzhou, China over the period 1998–2016. Principle components analysis was conducted to select key ecological environment and socioeconomic drivers conducive to DF transmission. Statistical models and machine learning regression algorithms, including ordinary least squares analysis, generalized linear and generalized additive models, and support vector regression were utilized to model the occurrence of DF over a long period. Population density, night-time light, travel and land use were selected as key factors. According to the overall performance of the four models, a DF model based on a generalized additive model was chosen as having the best performance. This model not only detected significantly non-linear relationships between key ecological environment and socioeconomic drivers and the occurrence of DF with high correlation coefficient, but also perfectly fitted extreme outbreaks of DF. We have made suggestions about policies and measures regarding its prevention in Guangzhou and other regions where it is endemic from the perspectives of ecological environment and socioeconomic factors. This study aims to shed light on the role of the ecological environment and socioeconomic factors in the transmission of DF and provide the scientific basis and guidance for its future prevention and control. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China ( 2016YFA0600104 ) and Key Special Project for Introduced Talents Team of Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Guangzhou) ( GML2019ZD0601 ).,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089957545,No,China,Healthcare/Wellbeing,Health & Well-being,Social Equity & Quality of Life,Machine Learning,Analysis,Study ecological and socioeconomic factors driving dengue fever transmission in Guangzhou,SDG 3,Empirical,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Remarkable urban growth rates are observed in developing or newly industrialized countries where researchers, planners, and authorities face scarcity of relevant official data or geo-data. In this study, we explore remote sensing and open geo-data as alternative sources to generate missing data for transportation models in urban planning and research. We propose a multi-modal approach capable of assessing three essential parameters of the urban spatial structure: buildings, land use, and intra-urban population distribution. Therefore, we first create a very high-resolution (VHR) 3D city model for estimating the building floors. Second, we add detailed land-use information retrieved from OpenStreetMap (OSM). Third, we test and evaluate five experiments to estimate population at a single building level. In our experimental set-up for the mega-city of Santiago de Chile, we find that the multi-modal approach allows generating missing data for transportation independently from official data for any area across the globe. Beyond that, we find the high-level 3D city model is the most accurate for determining population on small scales, and thus evaluate that the integration of land use is an inevitable step to obtain fine-scale intra-urban population distribution. © 2021 Dorothee Stiller, Michael Wurm, Thomas Stark, Pablo d’Angelo, Karsten Stebner, Stefan Dech & Hannes Taubenböck.",Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the financial funding by the German Federal Government and the Helm-holtz-Gesellschaft as part of the project “Transport and Climate (TraK).” This research was also funded in part by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under grant no. 03G0876 (project RIESGOS).We thank Ihab Kaddoura for profound discussions and helpful support.

A new inconsistent context fusion algorithm based on back propagation (BP) neural network and modified Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) combination rule is proposed in this paper to eliminate the inconsistency to the greatest extent and obtain accurate recognition results. Through the BP neural network, the situations of entities can be recognized effectively, and based on the modified combination rule, the recognition results can be fused legitimately and meaningfully. In order to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, several experiments under different error rates of context information sources are conducted in the personal identity verification (PIV) application scenario.

In the existing literature, the state-of-the-art method solve region-based problems with long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms that extract the temporal view and local convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms that extract the spatial view (local spatial correlation via local CNN). In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based method for region-based prediction for smart cities. First, we divide the cities into regions based on the space dimension and model the situation of the cities in 3D volumes. Based on the constructed 3D volumes, we design a model called multiple local 3D CNN spatial-temporal residual networks (LMST3D-ResNet) for region-based prediction in smart cities. LMST3D-ResNet can extract multiple temporal dependencies (including trend, period and closeness) for local regions and then predict the future citywide activities according to the learned multiple spatial-temporal features. LMST3D-ResNet can also combine the spatial-temporal features with external factors. LMST3D-ResNet includes 3D CNNs and ResNet mechanisms for processing spatial-temporal information. In particular, 3D CNNs have the ability to model 3-dimensional information due to 3D convolution and 3D pooling operations, while ResNet enables the connection of the convolutional neural network across layers to obtain a deeper network structure. Specifically, in our proposed model, a novel region-based information extraction mechanism and an end-to-end multiple spatial-temporal dependency learning structure are designed for local regions. Extensive experimental results on two datasets, i.e., MLElectricity and BJTaxi demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method over the exisiting state-of-the-art methods. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","The research was partially funded by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2018YFB1003401), the National Outstanding Youth Science Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61625202), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61902120), the Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 2019M662768, 2019TQ0086) and the International (Regional) Cooperation and Exchange Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61661146006, 61860206011).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089079437,Yes,China,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,3D CNN,Prediction/Forecasting,Develop multiple local 3D CNNs for region-based prediction in smart cities,SDG 11,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Longitudinal,Strong

With this objective, a mobile app based on the integration of the smartphone sensors and a fuzzy logic strategy to determine the pedestrian’s crossing intention around crosswalks is presented. The app developed also allows the calculation, tracing and guidance of safe routes thanks to an optimization algorithm that includes pedestrian areas on the paths generated over the whole city through a cloud database (i.e., zebra crossings, pedestrian streets and walkways). The experimentation carried out consisted in testing the fuzzy logic strategy with a total of 31 volunteers crossing and walking around a crosswalk. For that, the fuzzy logic approach was subjected to a total of 3120 samples generated by the volunteers. It has been proven that a smartphone can be successfully used as a crossing intention detector system with an accuracy of 98.63%, obtaining a true positive rate of 98.27% and a specificity of 99.39% according to a receiver operating characteristic analysis. Finally, a total of 30 routes were calculated by the proposed algorithm and compared with Google Maps considering the values of time, distance and safety along the routes.

We propose a full pipeline to automatically read watermeters based on a single image, using deep learning methods to provide new technical support for an intelligent water meter reading. To handle the various challenging environments where watermeters reside, our pipeline disentangled the task into individual subtasks based on the structures of typical wa-termeters. These subtasks include component localization, orientation alignment, spatial layout guidance reading, and regression-based pointer reading. The devised algorithms for orientation alignment and spatial layout guidance are tailored to improve the robustness of our neural network. We also collect images of watermeters in real scenes and build a dataset for training and evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method even under challenging environments with varying lighting, occlusions, and different orientations. Thanks to the lightweight algorithms adopted in our pipeline, the system can be easily deployed and fully automated. © 2021 by the authors.

To obtain the historical dynamics of the LULC, a supervised classification algorithm was applied to the Landsat images of 1992, 2002, and 2011. Based on spatial drivers and LULC of 1992 and 2002, the multiple perceptron neural network (MLPNN)-based Markov chain model (MCM) was applied to simulate the LULC in 2011, which was further validated using kappa statistics. Thereafter, by using 2002 and 2011 LULC, MLPNN-MCM was applied to predict the LULC in 2050. This study predicted the prompt urban growth over the suburban regions of Mumbai, which shows, by 2050, the Urban class will occupy 46.87% (1328.77 km2) of the entire study area. As compared to the LULC in 2011, the Urban and Forest areas in 2050 will increase by 14.31% and 2.05%, respectively, while the area under the Agriculture/Sparsely Vegetated and Barren land will decline by 16.87%. The class of water and the coastal feature will experience minute fluctuations (<1%) in the future. The predicted LULC for 2050 can be used as a thematic map in various climatic, environmental, and urban planning models to achieve the aims of sustainable development over the region. © 2021 by the authors.

The establishment of high-tech policing in Lahore, Pakistan, known as the Punjab Safe Cities Authority (PSCA), Lahore, along with integrated command and control centers and various equipments, such as 8,000 cameras, monitoring sensors, etc., has resulted in a requirement for its performance evaluation and social media–enabled opinion mining to determine the broader impact on communities.

Today, it is strongly believed that the autonomous vehicles’ introduction into the traffic will increase the road safety. However, driverless cars are not the solution by themselves. The road safety and, accordingly, sustainability will strongly depend on decision making algorithms inbuilt into the control module. The Intelligent System for fully- or semi- autonomous vehicle that we suggest consists of 3 modules: (1) an Object detection module; (2) a Data analysis module; (3) a Knowledge database built on decision rules generated with the help of our data mining algorithm. Despite there are a lot of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, the question is how to derive knowledge from the data possessed and how to use modern technologies to make driving safer. That’s why the main influence on any Driver Assistant system is done by the artificial intelligence algorithm (AI) used. Since an AI algorithm is a set of decision rules that target a specific problem to solve, the novelty of our proposed Intelligent System for fully- or semi- autonomous vehicle is concluded in our EAV (Entity–Attribute–Value) model based decision making algorithm.

Ensuring the reliability and safety of the railway tracks requires the development of new scientific approaches to the use of welding technologies in the construction and operation of a high-speed railway. The main criterion for evaluating efficiency of the new approaches is the quality of the resulting welded joints and the productivity of the welding processes used. Rail connections should be made in such a way from a technical point of view that there are no restrictions during operation, the service life of the rails is not reduced, the percentage of defects does not increase, and the noise level is within the normal limits. The purpose of the study is to substantiate the cost-effectiveness and safety of the introduction of new contact welding technologies in Russia. Technical and economic analysis of welding methods is given, including using the rail welding machines — a new generation of equipment for the contact butt welding of high-strength rails during the construction and reconstruction of a high-speed railway. The Up-to-date technologies are based on the process of contact welding by pulsating reflow, on the one hand ensuring high productivity of the process, and on the other — reducing the influence of the human factor on it. This is achieved through a set of options for controlling the welding process, with online monitoring of the operational characteristics, with the software for storage and the possibility of using robotic welding in the future in the field of digital doubles and processing archived data based on the artificial intelligence as part of the implementation of Smart City projects. Feasibility study is also presented concerning the efficiency of the introduction of contact welding technology by the pulsed reflow on high-speed railway projects of Russia based on reducing the rail joint failures and improving the characteristics of the welding process and safe operation. © 2021, STC Industrial Safety CJSC.

The author considers different approaches to the conceptualization of “digital divides” and to the study of their socio-political consequences, analyzes the main dimensions and levels of digital divide in the context of current socio-political processes and development trends, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, and considers different approaches to overcome them in a modern megacity. Three main levels of digital divide in modern societies are identified and characterized: 1) the availability of the material basis for the use of digital technology (technical level); 2) the skills for its use by different people (social level); and 3) the real opportunities for full participation of the individual in the life of a modern “digital” society and democratic participation in political and social processes, including the realization of their civil rights and freedoms, in expanding social connections and relations (political level). It is shown that while these three “traditional” types of digital gaps – inequalities in access to ICT, in the level of digital skills and in the possibility of full participation in the political life of modern digital society – remain and grow in importance in the megacity context, their new aspects, such as access to big data sets (Big Data), the degree of dependence on automated decision-making systems (algorithms) using artificial intelligence technologies, and digital exclusion and separation on the relational level are becoming increasingly important. Some socio-political implications of the new digital divide and the associated political risks are identified. It is concluded that the measures taken to mitigate and reduce the digital divide in the modern metropolis have so far been mostly partial and palliative, with a focus on improving the material basis for the use of digital technologies rather than on overcoming the deeper sociopolitical causes and consequences of digital divisions and gaps. It is shown that policies to reduce the digital divide and digital inequality in modern megacities are particularly important because megacities are home to the most politically active populations. © 2022",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85129593864,No,Russia,Governance/Policy,Governance & Society,Social Equity & Quality of Life,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Analyze digital divide problems and political aspects in megacities,"SDG 10, SDG 11",Conceptual/Theoretical,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Existing maps have limitations, in that they are (1) mapped using coarse-resolution remote-sensing data, resulting in the lack of precise mapping location of croplands and their accuracies; (2) derived by collecting and collating national statistical data that are often subjective, leading to substantial uncertainties in cropland-area estimates, as well as their locations; and (3) extracted from one or more classes of a land use–land cover product in which cropland classes are not the focus of mapping, leading to their mixing with other classes and creating significant errors of omission and commission. These limitations can be overcome by producing high-resolution cropland-extent maps using satellite-sensor data, such as Landsat 30-m resolution or higher. The most fundamental cropland product is the high-resolution cropland-extent map because all higher level cropland products, such as crop-watering method (that is, whether crops are irrigated or rainfed), crop types, cropping intensities, cropland fallows, crop productivity, and crop-water productivity, are dependent on a precise and accurate cropland-extent product. Given these realities, the overarching goal of this study was to produce a Landsat satellite-derived global cropland-extent product at 30-m resolution. The work, which involved a paradigm shift in how global cropland-extent maps are produced, involved the following five key steps: (1) petabyte-scale computing that involved multiyear, 8- to 16-day, time-series Landsat 30-m resolution data for the global land surface; (2) composition of analysis-ready data (ARD) cubes; (3) creation of a large global-reference data hub for machine learning; (4) use of multiple machine-learning algorithms (MLAs) by writing software and computing in the cloud; and (5) Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing. The five key steps involved nine distinct phases. First, the world was segmented into 74 agroecological zones (AEZs). Second, Landsat 8- to 16-day data were used to time-composite 10-band (blue, green, red, near-infrared, short-wave infrared band 1, short-wave infrared band 2, thermal infrared, enhanced vegetation index, normalized difference water index, and normalized difference vegetation index) Landsat 30-m resolution data cubes for every 2- to 4-month time period during 3- to 4-year periods (stated as nominal-year 2015 or, simply, 2015), along with two additional 30-m resolution bands (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission elevation, and slope) in each of the 74 AEZs. Third, more than 100,000 reference-training data samples were collected using ground data (some of which were collected using a mobile application), as well as submeter- to 5-m-resolution, very high-resolution imagery sourced from other reliable sources. Fourth, reference-training data were used to create a knowledge base for separating cropland from noncropland. Fifth, MLAs such as the pixel-based supervised random forest and support-vector machines were written on the GEE using Python and JavaScript. Sixth, object-based recursive hierarchical segmentation algorithm was used, in addition to MLAs, to overcome uncertainties. Seventh, MLAs used the knowledge base to classify and separate cropland from noncropland. Eighth, accuracy assessment was conducted by generating error matrices for each of the 74 AEZs using 19,171 independent validation-data samples. Ninth, cropland areas were computed for all countries of the world and compared with United Nation’s (UN’s) Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and other national statistics. The outcome was a Landsat-derived global cropland-extent product at 30-m resolution (GCEP30), which has an overall accuracy of 91.7 percent. For the cropland class, producer’s accuracy was 83.4 percent, and user’s accuracy was 78.3 percent. GCEP30 calculated (using direct pixel count) the global net-cropland area (GNCA) for the year 2015 as 1.873 billion hectares (~12.6 percent of the Earth’s terrestrial area). The continental cropland distribution as a percentage of GNCA was Asia, 33 percent; Europe, 25.5 percent; Africa, 16.7 percent; North America, 14.4 percent; South America, 8.1 percent; and Australia and Oceania, 2.4 percent. The worldwide cropland areas in GCEP30 for 2015 were higher by 236 to 299 million hectares (Mha) compared to national statistics reported elsewhere for the same year (for example, in Food and Agriculture Organization’s corporate statistical database [FAOSTAT] and in the monthly irrigated and rainfed crop areas [MIRCA] database). The global cropland area reported for 2015 increased by 344 Mha (22.5 percent), compared to the year 2000. During the same period (2000–2015), the world’s population increased by 20 percent. Whereas some of these areal increases are real increases in cropland areas, others are due to the types of data, methods, and approaches used. Using the highest known resolution (compared to previous coarse-resolution global products) enabled this study to capture fragmented croplands. Coarse-resolution data compute areas on the basis of subpixels, which, for a large proportion of certain land use–land cover classes, will show only a certain percentage of the total pixel area as actual area. Subpixel areas can lead to substantial uncertainties in area computation, as determining the exact fraction of cropland areas within a coarse-resolution pixel is resource intensive and subject to errors. Other innovations in GCEP30 include reference-data hubs, machine learning, and cloud computing. Cropland areas in 214 countries, territories, departments, and regions were calculated for the year 2015 using GCEP30, on the basis of UN’s global administrative unit layers (GAUL) boundaries. The 10 leading countries in terms of cropland area (as a percentage of the GNCA) were India (9.6 percent), United States (8.95 percent), China (8.82 percent), Russia (8.32 percent), Brazil (3.42 percent), Ukraine (2.32 percent), Canada (2.29 percent), Argentina (2.05 percent), Indonesia (2 percent), and Nigeria (1.91 percent). Together, these 10 countries occupy 50 percent of the global cropland, and they have 52 percent of the global population. Their combined cropland area increased by 2 percent between 2000 and 2015, compared to the substantial increase in population of 517 million (15.5 percent). Together, India, United States, China, and Russia encompass 36 percent of the total area. In the United States and Canada, from 2000 to 2015, cropland decreased by about 2 percent, whereas their populations increased by 14 and 13 percent, respectively. The additional food requirements in these 10 countries, which are caused by increased populations, as well as increasing nutritional demands, are met by production increases in existing cropland or through virtual food trade, or both. More than 18 countries, territories, departments, or regions had 60 percent or more of their geographic area as cropland: Republic of Moldova, San Marino, and Hungary had more than 80 percent of the country’s area as cropland; Denmark, Ukraine, Ireland, and Bangladesh, 70 to 80 percent; and Uruguay, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Spain, Lithuania, Poland, Gaza Strip, Czechia, Italy, India, and Azerbaijan, 60 to 70 percent. Europe and South Asia can be considered agricultural capitals of the world, on the basis of their percentages of geographic area as cropland. United States, China, and Russia, which all have high cropland areas, are ranked second, third, and fourth in the world; India is ranked first. However, the amount of cropland as a percentage of the country’s geographic area is relatively very low for United States (18.3 percent), China (17.7 percent), and Russia (9.5 percent), whereas it is 60.5 percent for India. Most African and South American countries, territories, departments, or regions have less than 15 percent of their geographic area as cropland. China and India together house 36 percent of the world’s population; however, between 2000 and 2015, the amount of China’s cropland area fell by 18.9 percent, owing to urban expansion and the abandonment of farmlands caused by demographic changes (that is, the movement of population from villages to cities). In contrast, China’s population grew by 10 percent. The amount of India’s cropland increased by 8.5 percent, whereas its population grew by 20 percent. This study showed that, out of the 10 leading cropland countries, Ukraine, Nigeria, Russia, and Indonesia showed an 18 to 31 percent increase in cropland areas, on the basis of GCEP30 by the year 2015, compared to 2000. Nigeria’s cropland area increased by 25 percent, and its population increased by 31 percent in the same period. In these countries, food security is maintained by cropland expansion, productivity increases, and virtual food trade. Nevertheless, this trend of increasing net-cropland area and productivity will likely become difficult to maintain, owing to diminishing arable lands and plateauing of 50 years of continual yield increases, requiring policymakers to explore novel and data-supported approaches to solving future food security issues.

Traditionally, the exploration in travel mode choice modeling has been dominated by the Discrete Choice model, nonetheless, owing to the advancement in computational techniques, machine learning has gained traction in understanding travel behavior. Aim: This study aims at predicting users’ travel model choice by means of machine learning models against a conventional Discrete Choice Model, i.e., Binary Logistic Regression. Objective: To investigate the comparison between machine learning models, namely Neural Network, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine against the Discrete Choice Model (Binary Logistic Regression) in the prediction of travel mode choice amongst Kuantan City. Methodology: The dataset was collected in Kuantan City, Malaysia, through the Revealed/Stated Preferences (RP/SP) Survey. The data collected was split into a ratio of 80:20 for training and testing before evaluating them between the aforesaid models. The hyperparameters of the models were set to default. The performance of the models is evaluated based on classification accuracy. Results: It was shown in the present study that the Neural Network Model is able to attain a higher prediction accuracy as compared to Binary Logistic Regression (Discrete Choice Model) in classifying mode choice of Kuantan users either to choose public transport or private vehicles as daily transportation. Feature importance technique is crucial for identifying the significant features in modelling travel mode choice. It is demonstrated that the Neural Network Model can yield exceptional classification of mode choice up to 73.4% and 72.4% of training and testing data, respectively, by considering the features identified via the feature importance technique, suggesting the viability of the proposed technique in supporting an informed decision. Conclusion: The findings highlight the strengths and limitations of the Machine Learning Technique as well as the Discrete Choice Model in modeling travel mode choice. It was shown that Machine Learning models have the capability to provide better prediction that could assist the urban transportation planning among policymakers. Meanwhile, it could be also demonstrated that the Discrete Choice Model (Binary Logistic Regression) is helpful in getting a better understanding in expressing the inference relationship between variables for improvising the future transportation system. © 2021 Ali et al.","This study is funded by the Graduate Assistant Scheme by Universiti Sains Malaysia, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85128816156,Yes,Malaysia,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,"Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression",Classification,Compare machine learning models with discrete choice models for travel mode choice prediction,SDG 11,Empirical,Mixed,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Weak

This trend is revolutionizing multiple application domains along the whole human activity spectrum, while pushing the growth of new businesses and innovations such as smart manufacturing, cities and transportation systems, as well as personalized healthcare. Technological advances in the Internet of Things, Big Data, Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence have effected tremendous progress toward the autonomic control of SCPS operations. However, the inherently dynamic nature of physical environments challenges SCPS' ability to perform adequate control actions over managed physical assets in myriad of contexts. From a design perspective, this issue is related to the system states of operation that cannot be predicted entirely at design time, and the consequential need to define adequate capabilities for run-time self-adaptation and self-evolution. Nevertheless, adaptation and evolution actions must be assessed before realizing them in the managed system in order to ensure resiliency while minimizing the risks. Therefore, the design of SCPS must address not only dependable autonomy but also operational resiliency. In light of this, the contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we propose a reference architecture for designing dependable and resilient SCPS that integrates concepts from the research areas of Digital Twin, Adaptive Control and Autonomic Computing. Second, we propose a model identification mechanism for guiding self-evolution, based on continuous experimentation, evolutionary optimization and dynamic simulation, as the architecture's first major component for dependable autonomy. Third, we propose an adjustment mechanism for self-adaptation, based on gradient descent, as the architecture's second major component, addressing operational resiliency. Our contributions aim to further advance the research of reliable self-adaptation and self-evolution mechanisms and their inclusion in the design of SCPS. Finally, we evaluate our contributions by implementing prototypes and showing their viability using real data from a case study in the domain of intelligent transportation systems. © 2021 - IOS Press.

This traditional approach has been challenged, however, by the current new practices in archaeological studies, which tend to rely on more scientific methods (e.g. information systems) to understand the wider context of the socio-cultural aspects of past societies. For example, the Nabataean studies, which for more than seventeen decades after the rediscovery of Petra in 1812, are based on the art historical analysis of the rock-cut facades of the the city of Petra. The wider story of the socio-cultural, political, and economic aspects of the Nabataean culture is still not well understood. Just recently archaeological research was undertaken to improve the understanding of the Nabaatean phenomenon from outside Petra. This paper discusses this new attempt to investigate the spatial organization and land use of Wadi Musa during the Nabataean period based on GIS analysis and new archaeological discoveries. Utilizing GIS in discovering historical phenomena provides a new perspective for analysis, whereby structures are treated not as individual archaeological items but rather as a system. This paper also presents a case study that demonstrates the significance of using GIS for historical research by shedding light on the temporal variation of Wadi Musa settlements with special focus on the paleo-landuse of the Nabatean period. The resulting reconstructed map indicates that Wadi Musa was well planned with special zones for elite residents, industry, rural communities, and agriculture. Social segregation/stratification is also well indicated in the plan of the city. The reconstructed map indicates that the strategy for Nabataean land use for Wadi Musa was to use it as a green zone around the city of Gaia. © 2021 IJOG.

With regard to fire safety, artificial intelligence algorithms that evaluate fire prone facilities based on spatial information are applied to smart cities. This study analyzed the applicability of fire risk evaluation technologies based on spatial information as core technologies for smart cities. To this end, a fire risk evaluation based on spatial information was performed in an area designated as a target zone for a housing environment improvement project in Daegu, South Korea. The evaluation involved the application of a main fire risk evaluation system consisting of 12 evaluation items. Data was obtained using drones, orthophotos, numerical maps, and building ledgers; the obtained data and a GIS-based fire risk evaluation platform were used to evaluate the level of fire risk in the target area. The evaluation result showed that fire risks according to the unit of a building or a district were effectively evaluated by the application of the spatial information-based fire risk evaluation technology. Furthermore, the application of this technology was shown to enable the effective calculation of scores for each evaluation item. © International Journal of Sustainable Building Technology and Urban Development.","Program (TARP) funded by Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of Korean Government.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123507714,Yes,South Korea,Safety/Crime,Security & Safety,Urban Resilience & Safety,Spatial Information AI,Risk Assessment,Apply spatial information-based fire risk evaluation for smart city development,"SDG 11, SDG 13",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

In this study, we propose a smart parking system using deep learning and an application-based approach. This system has two modules, one module detects and recognizes a license plate (LP), and the other selects a parking space; both modules use deep learning techniques. We used two modules that work independently to detect and recognize an LP by using an image of the vehicle. To detect parking space, only deep learning techniques were used. The two modules were compared with other state-of-the-art solutions. We utilized the You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture to detect and recognize an LP because its performance in the context of Saudi Arabian LP numbers was superior to that of other solutions. Compared with existing state-of-the-art solutions, the performance of the proposed solution was more effective. The solution can be further improved for use in the city and large organizations that have priority parking spaces. A dataset of LP-annotated images of vehicles was used. The results of this study have considerable implications for smart parking, particularly in universities; in addition, they can be utilized for smart cities. © 2021 CRL Publishing.

This study used Remote Sensing (RS) to detect and quantify LULC changes that occurred in the city throughout a twenty-year study period, using Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) images from 1999 and 2010 and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images from 2019. A supervised classification method using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was used to classify and map LULC types. The kappa coefficient and the overall accuracy were used to ascertain the classification accuracy. Using the classified images, a postclassification comparison approach was used to detect LULC changes between 1999 and 2019. The study revealed that built-up land and agricultural land increased in their respective areas by 28.54 km2 (194.81%) and 35.80 km2 (27.16%) with corresponding annual change rates of 1.43 km·year-1 and 1.79 km·year-1. The area of bare land, forest land, herbaceous land, and waterbody, respectively, decreased by 0.05%, 90.52%, 71.67%, and 6.90%.

These events are difficult to be overcome both by the populations and by government authorities. Two challenging issues require in particular to be addressed: find an effective way to evacuate people first, and later to rebuild houses and other infrastructures. An adequate recovery strategy to evacuate people and start reconstructing damaged areas on a priority basis can then be a game changer allowing to overcome effectively those terrible circumstances. In this perspective, we here present DiReCT, an approach based on i) a dynamic optimization model designed to timely formulate an evacuation plan of an area struck by an earthquake, and ii) a decision support system, based on double deep Q Network, able to guide efficiently the reconstruction the affected areas. The latter works by considering both the resources available and the needs of the various stakeholders involved (e.g., residents social benefits and political priorities). The ground on which both the above solutions stand was a dedicated geographical data extraction algorithm, called 'GisToGraph', especially developed for this purpose. To check applicability of the whole approach, we dovetailed it on the real use-case of the historical city center of L'Aquila (Italy) using detailed GIS data and information on urban land structure and buildings vulnerability. Several simulations were run on the underlining network generated. First, we ran experiments to safely evacuate in the shortest possible time as many people as possible from an endangered area towards a set of safe places. Then, using DDQN, we generated different reconstruction plans and selected the best ones considering both social benefits and political priorities of the building units.

In this sense, smart cities applied artificial intelligence techniques to offload data for social governance. Bicycle sharing is the last mile of urban transport. The number of the bike in the sharing stations, to be rented in future periods, is predicted to get the vehicles ready for deployment. It is an important tool for the implementation of smart cities using artificial intelligence technologies. We propose a DBSCAN-TCN model for predicting the number of rentals at shared bicycle stations. The proposed model first clusters all shared bicycle stations using the DBSCAN clustering algorithm. Based on the results of the clustering, the data on the number of shared bicycle rentals are fed into a TCN neural network. The TCN neural network structure is optimized. The effects of convolution kernel size and Dropout rate on the model performance are discussed. Finally, the proposed DBSCAN-TCN model is compared with the LSTM model, Kalman filtering model, and autoregressive moving average model. Through experimental validation, the proposed DBSCAN-TCN model outperforms the traditional three models in terms of two metrics, root mean squared logarithmic error, and error rate, in terms of prediction performance. © 2021 Dazhou Li et al.",The project is supported by the Science and Technology Funds from Liaoning Education Department (No. LJ2020033 and No. LJKZ0449) and the National Social Science Foundation (No. 19CKS050).,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121586029,Yes,China,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,"DBSCAN, TCN",Prediction/Forecasting,Forecast short-term IoT data for urban public bicycle systems using DBSCAN-TCN model,SDG 11,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Medium

Combining Internet of Things (IoT) devices with a decentralized network secures data transmission from machines to support cloud-based smart city applications. Critical applications such as Smart Healthcare deploy portable IoT devices such as blood pressure monitors, pacemakers, and electrocardiogram (ECG)- supported smartwatches to provide personalized services to users. Devices frequently move between different base stations to improve their coverage in hotspots and wireless link quality. Immutable ledgers in decentralized base stations ensure that data transmission from base stations to data centers is secure; still, it does not guarantee that the received data is from an authorized device. In the IoT layer, impersonation attacks involve a malicious user spoofing an honest user and transmitting manipulated data to the base station. Attackers impersonate legitimate machines during the handover authentication process when devices move from one base station to another. This paper proposes a fast, efficient handover authentication (HO-Auth) scheme using deep learning to authenticate devices and build a user profile-based system for immediate authorization. The channel state information (CSI) of a user’s movement pattern trains the model and detects malicious users spoofing as honest users. The simulation-based analysis shows an initial profile accuracy of 0.91 in identifying a malicious device. The detection accuracy increases to 0.94 as the profile is retrained based on the movement of the user.

The benefits of this paradigm are obvious, but these IoT environments have brought with them new challenges, such as detecting and combating cybersecurity attacks against cyber-physical systems. This paper addresses the real-time detection of security attacks in these IoT systems through the combined used of Machine Learning (ML) techniques and Complex Event Processing (CEP). In this regard, in the past we proposed an intelligent architecture that integrates ML with CEP, and which permits the definition of event patterns for the real-time detection of not only specific IoT security attacks, but also novel attacks that have not previously been defined. Our current concern, and the main objective of this paper, is to ensure that the architecture is not necessarily linked to specific vendor technologies and that it can be implemented with other vendor technologies while maintaining its correct functionality. We also set out to evaluate and compare the performance and benefits of alternative implementations. This is why the proposed architecture has been implemented by using technologies from different vendors: firstly, the Mule Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) together with the Esper CEP engine; and secondly, the WSO2 ESB with the Siddhi CEP engine. Both implementations have been tested in terms of performance and stress, and they are compared and discussed in this paper. The results obtained demonstrate that both implementations are suitable and effective, but also that there are notable differences between them: the Mule-based architecture is faster when the architecture makes use of two message broker topics and compares different types of events, while the WSO2-based one is faster when there is a single topic and one event type, and the system has a heavy workload. © 2021.

As a result, a tremendous amount of data is generated and stored on MOOCs online learning platforms. In any case, this data should be effectively transformed into knowledge, thus providing valuable feedback to learners, and enhancing decision making practices in the educational field. Despite the benefits and learning prospects that MOOCs offer to learners, there is a considerable divergence between enrollment and completion rates. In this context, the main scope of this study is to exploit predictive analytics and explainable artificial intelligence for the early prediction of student certification in a 11-week MOOC for smart cities, namely DevOps. A plethora of Machine Learning models were built employing familiar classification algorithms. The experimental results revealed that the models based on Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression and Light Gradient Boosted Machine classifiers prevailed in terms of Accuracy, Area Under Curve, Recall, Precision, F1-score, Kappa, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient, getting a predictive accuracy of 94.41% at the end of the second week of the course. Therefore, students who are less likely to obtain a certificate could be envisaged at an early enough stage to provide sufficient support actions and targeted intervention strategies to them.

To protect IoT devices from cyberattacks, studies on malware detection using artificial intelligence are being conducted. However, with the emergence of IoT malware and their various evasion techniques, the probability of falsely detecting malware as benign is also increasing. In this study, we propose a two-stage hybrid malware detection (2-MaD) scheme for the protection of IoT devices from obfuscated malware in a smart city setting. The 2-MaD consists of two stages of IoT malware detection. First, after performing static analysis, the opcode is extracted, and using the learned information through a bidirectional long short-term memory model, benign files are detected. In the next stage, a dynamic analysis is performed on files classified as benign in a nested virtual environment. After extracting information on behavior and process memory from the behavior log based on system changes, malware can be detected through the trained EfficientNet-B3 model. © 2021,Human-centric Computing and Information Sciences.All Rights Reserved",This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2019R1A2C1088383).,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85120851398,Yes,South Korea,Security/Surveillance,Security & Safety,Urban Resilience & Safety,Deep Learning,Detection,Develop a two-stage hybrid deep learning approach for malware detection in IoT devices,"SDG 9, SDG 11",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

In order to improve the safety perception ability based on 5G-V2X, increase the detection speed in vehicle perception. A vehicle perception model is proposed. First, an adaptive feature extraction method is adopted to enhance the expression of small-scale features and improve the feature extraction ability of small-scale targets. Then, by improving the feature fusion method, the shallow information is fused layer by layer to solve the problem of feature loss. Finally, the attention enhancement method is introduced to increase the center point prediction ability and solve the problem of target occlusion. The experimental results show that the UA-DETRAC data set has a good detection effect.

Local climate zones (LCZ) are a classification scheme for urban areas considering urban land cover characteristics and the geometry and structure of buildings, which can be used for analyzing urban heat island effect in detail. This study aimed to examine the UHI effect by urban structure in Suwon and Daegu using the LCZ scheme. First, the LCZ maps were generated using Landsat 8 images and convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning over the two cities. Then, Surface UHI (SUHI), which indicates the land surface temperature (LST) difference between urban and rural areas, was analyzed by LCZ class. The results showed that the overall accuracies of the CNN models for LCZ classification were relatively high 87.9% and 81.7% for Suwon and Daegu, respectively. In general, Daegu had higher LST for all LCZ classes than Suwon. For both cities, LST tended to increase with increasing building density with relatively low building height. For both cities, the intensity of SUHI was very high in summer regardless of LCZ classes and was also relatively high except for a few classes in spring and fall. In winter the SUHI intensity was low, resulting in negative values for many LCZ classes. This implies that UHI is very strong in summer, and some urban areas often are colder than rural areas in winter. The research findings demonstrated the applicability of the LCZ data for SUHI analysis and can provide a basis for establishing timely strategies to respond urban on-going climate change over urban areas. © 2021 Korean Society of Remote Sensing.

However, added information from the sensor readings will burden the system and cause the sensors to produce inaccurate readings. To overcome these issues, this paper aims to focus on communication between sensors and autonomous vehicles for better decision-making in real-time. The system has unique features to detect the upcoming and ongoing vehicles automatically without intervention of humans in the system. It also predicts the type of vehicle and intimates the driver. Design/methodology/approach: The system is designed using the ATmega 328 P and ESP 8266 chip. Information from ultrasonic and infrared sensors are analyzed and updated in the cloud server. The user can access all these real-time data at any point of time. The stored information in cloud servers is used for integrating artificial intelligence into the system. Findings: The real-time sensor information is used to predict the surrounding environment and the system responds to the user according to the situation. Practical implications: The system is implemented on embedded platform with IoT technology. The sensor information is updated to the cloud using the Blynk application for the user in real time. Originality/value: The system is proposed for smart cities with IoT technology where the user and the system are aware of the surrounding environment. The system is mainly concerned with the accuracy of sensors and the distance between the vehicles in real-time environment. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85120483335,Yes,India,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,"IoT, AI",Detection,Develop a safety-driven intelligent autonomous vehicle for smart cities using IoT,SDG 11,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

IoT technology essentially facilitates a platform for service automation through connections of heterogeneous objects via the Internet backbone. However, the security issues associated with IoT networks make smart city infrastructure vulnerable to cyber-attacks. For example, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack violates the authorization conditions in smart city infrastructure; whereas replay attack violates the authentication conditions in smart city infrastructure. Both attacks lead to physical disruption to smart city infrastructure, which may even lead to financial loss and/or loss of human lives. In this paper, a hybrid deep learning model is developed for detecting replay and DDoS attacks in a real life smart city platform. The performance of the proposed hybrid model is evaluated using real life smart city datasets (environmental, smart river and smart soil), where DDoS and replay attacks were simulated. The proposed model reported high accuracy rates: 98.37% for the environmental dataset, 98.13% for the smart river dataset, and 99.51% for the smart soil dataset.

In order to deal with these phenomena, it is essential to have an in-depth understanding of the processes that lead to the occurrence of congestion and its spilling over into contiguous areas of the city. One of the main causes of congestion phenomena is unexpected traffic incidents on major roads and urban freeways, the rapid and reliable detection of which can help reduce negative impacts. Researching Automatic Incident Detection (AID) has a long history that has again become one of the main subjects of research with the rise of new machine learning methods. Our article presents a new Transient-based Automatic Incident Detection (TBAID) method we have developed, which uses an approach not yet seen in professional literature to detect the occurrence of incidents. The results of our detailed analysis showed that our method performed better than the methods currently available in terms of both speed and reliability on traffic data collected from freeways. We also created a new dataset for the examination of our method, because the datasets used in previous research were either too small or not publicly available.

In this article, we propose a regularized building boundaries extraction from remote sensing imagery based on augment feature pyramid network (AFPN) and morphological constraint. First, we build an AFPN, which can provide more accurate and dense global features for semantic segmentation tasks to avoid the loss of feature information. Second, the building shape is manually divided into linear and curved by analyzing the morphological characteristics. The extraction results are regularized to achieve the refined expression of contour according to different types of building shapes. Finally, we conduct experiments on the benchmark dataset to test the availability of the proposed approach. The results showed that the F1-score and intersection over union (IOU) reached 93.7% and 88.8%, respectively. Besides, our proposed approach is compared with some of the excellent research in recent years of models, such as PSPNet, Unet++, RefineNet, and DeconvNet. On the benchmark dataset, the proposed method increases the IOU by 0.9-2.7% and improves the F1-score by 0.2-2.5%.

This study aims to analyze the mobility performance of integrating bike-sharing into multimodal transport systems and develop a machine learning model to predict the performance of intermodal trips with bike-sharing compared with those without bike-sharing for a given trip using transit smart card data and bike-sharing GPS data from the city of Seoul. The results suggest that using bike-sharing in the intermodal trips where it performs better than buses could enhance the mobility performance by providing up to 34% savings in travel time per trip compared with the scenarios in which bus is used exclusively for the trips and up to 33% savings when bike-sharing trips are used exclusively. The results of the machine learning models suggest that the random forest classifier outperformed three other classifiers with an accuracy of 90% in predicting the performance of bike-sharing and intermodal transit trips. Further analysis and applications of the mobility performance of bike-sharing in Seoul are presented and discussed. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2021.,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (2020R1F1A1061802).

The building boundary detection in the desert environment is a real challenge due to the nature of low contrast images in the desert environment. The traditional computer vision algorithms for building boundary detection lack scalability, robustness, and accuracy. On the other hand, deep learning detection algorithms have not been applied to such low contrast satellite images. So, there is a real need to employ deep learning algorithms for building detection tasks in low contrast high-resolution images. In this paper, we propose a novel building detection method based on a single-shot multi-box (SSD) detector. We develop the state-of-the-art SSD detection algorithm based on three approaches. First, we propose data-augmentation techniques to overcome the low contrast images’appearance. Second, we develop the SSD backbone using a novel saliency visual attention mechanism. Moreover, we investigate several pre-trained networks performance and several fusion functions to increase the performance of the SSD backbone. The third approach is based on optimizing the anchor-boxes sizes which are used in the detection stage to increase the performance of the SSD head. During our experiments, we have prepared a new dataset for buildings inside Riyadh City, Saudi Arabia that consists of 3878 buildings. We have compared our proposed approach vs other approaches in the literature. The proposed system has achieved the highest average precision, recall, F1-score, and IOU performance. Our proposed method has achieved a fast average prediction time with the lowest variance for our testing set.

The air quality index (AQI) is an important evaluation index of air pollution, describing the degree of air pollution and its impact on the health of human beings. Therefore, it is particularly important for smart cities to accurately predict AQI. The accuracy of AQI prediction remains a challenge for current methods. In this paper, an AQI prediction model based on CA-GRU is proposed, which includes convolutional neural networks (CNN), attention mechanism, and gated recurrent unit (GRU). In this model, the feature extraction of input data is realised through CNN, weights are assigned according to the states of old data with attention mechanism and the AQI is predicted with GRU. To prove the validity and accuracy of the CA-GRU prediction model, we take experiments using air quality data and weather data from 1st January 2017 at 00:00 to 30th September 2020 at 23:00 in Shijiazhuang City of China and compare this model with other models.

Therefore, scheduled road surface inspections can extend service life while guaranteeing users security and comfort. Traditional manual and visual inspections don’t meet the nowadays criteria, in addition to a relatively high time volume consumption. Smart City pavement management preventive approach requires accurate and scalable data to deduce significant indicators and plan efficient maintenance programs. However, the quality of data depends on sensors used and conditions during scanning. Many studies focused on different sensors, Machine Learning algorithms and Deep Neural Networks tried to find a sustainable solution. Besides all these studies, pavement distress measurement stills a challenge in Smarts Cities because distress detection is not enough to decide on maintenance actions required. Damages localization, dimensions and future development should be highly detected on real-time. This paper summarizes the state-of-the-art methods and technologies used in recent years in pavement distress detection, classification and measurement. The aim is to evaluate current methods and highlight their limitations, to lay out the blueprint for future researches.

While there are many research efforts focused on urban buildings extraction, there are few studies on large-scale urban building mapping based on satellite images. In this research, a large-scale urban building mapping scheme based on Gaofen-2 satellite (GF-2) images is proposed based on a hierarchical approach. In this hierarchical approach, urban buildings are regarded as a mixture of dense low-rise buildings (DLBs) and sparse independent buildings (SIBs) stacked in space, which are extracted by a semantic segmentation model and an instance segmentation model, respectively. In this study, GF-2 images and OpenStreetMap data were used to extract DLB using $U^2$-Net with focal loss. GF-2 images were used to extract SIB using an improved CenterMask model with a deformable convolution network and a spatial coordinate attention module. The main urban area within the 5th ring road of Beijing was selected as the study area. With the trained model, the GF-2 image tiles of Beijing input into the models to first derive coarse maps of DLB and SIB. Postprocessing optimization was performed after combining the maps. The accuracy assessment shows that the overall accuracy of large-scale urban building mapping using the hierarchical approach proposed in this article reaches 91.5%, which is 4.8% higher than that with a traditional method. Overall, the hierarchical approach proposed in this article is effective in large-scale urban building mapping and provides new application opportunities. © 2008-2012 IEEE.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118531083,Yes,China,Urban Planning,Urban Planning & Land Use,Urban Development & Land Use,Deep Learning,Classification,Develop a large-scale urban building mapping scheme using deep learning and hierarchical approach,SDG 11,Methodological,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

The aim of smart healthcare is two folds. The internal healthcare system has a sole focus on monitoring vital parameters of patients. The external systems provide proactive health care measures by the surveillance mechanism. This system utilizes the surveillance mechanism giving impetus to healthcare tagging requirements on the general public. The work exclusively deals with the mass gatherings and crowded places scenarios. Crowd gatherings and public places management is a vital challenge in any smart city environment. Protests and dissent are commonly observed crowd behavior. This behavior has the inherent capacity to transform into violent behavior. The paper explores a novel and deep learningbased method to provide an Internet of Things (IoT) environment-based decision support system for tagging healthcare systems for the people who are injured in crowd protests and violence. The proposed system is intelligent enough to classify protests into normal, medium and severe protest categories. The level of the protests is directly tagged to the nearest healthcare systems and generates the need for specialist healthcare professionals. The proposed system is an optimized solution for the people who are either participating in protests or stranded in such a protest environment. The proposed solution allows complete tagging of specialist healthcare professionals for all types of emergency response in specialized crowd gatherings. Experimental results are encouraging and have shown the proposed system has a fairly promising accuracy of more than eight one percent in classifying protest attributes and more than ninety percent accuracy for differentiating protests and violent actions. The numerical results are motivating enough for and it can be extended beyond proof of the concept into real time external surveillance and healthcare tagging. ©2021 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85117894707,Yes,India,Healthcare/Wellbeing,Health & Well-being,Social Equity & Quality of Life,CNN,Classification,Apply CNN framework for tagging healthcare systems in crowd protest environments,"SDG 3, SDG 11",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

The Lahore district is situated in the Punjab province of Pakistan and is mainly comprised of Lahore city. This city is among the fastest expanding cities in Pakistan. Due to this rapid urbanization, the natural land surfaces are being altered, harming the local environment and thus causing the urban heat island (UHI) effect. For the analysis of the UHI effect, the fundamental and essential step is assessing the land surface temperature (LST). Therefore, the current investigation assessed LST to evaluate the UHI effect of the Lahore district. This study used the remote sensing data retrieved from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM) and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. Different new generation algorithms were initially used, but a convolutional neural network (CNN) model was used based on the accuracy. The model was developed by utilizing the past 19 years’ LST values along with elevation, road density (RD), and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) as input parameters for analyzing and predicting the LST. The LST data of the year 2020 was used for the validation of the outcomes of the CNN model. Among the model predicted LST and observed LST, a high correlation was noticed. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean squared error (MSE) for the considered two different periods (January and May) were also computed for both the training and validation processes. The prediction error for most parts of the district was within 0.1 K of the observed values. Hence, the formulated CNN model can be utilized as an essential tool for analyzing and predicting LST and thus for the evaluation of the UHI effect at any location. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.","The authors of this research are grateful to the anonymous reviewers for their enlightening comments, which assisted in sharpening the manuscript.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85117616144,Yes,Pakistan,Urban Climate,Environment & Sustainability,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Machine Learning,Prediction/Forecasting,Develop a prediction model for land surface temperature and urban heat island effect drivers,"SDG 11, SDG 13",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Longitudinal,Strong

An intelligent transportation system can analyze the traffic data with time and space characteristics in the city and acquire rich and valuable knowledge, and it is of great significance to realize intelligent traffic scheduling and urban planning. This article specifically introduces the extensive application of urban transportation infrastructure data in the construction and development of smart cities. This article first explains the related concepts of big data and intelligent transportation systems and uses big data to illustrate the operation of intelligent transportation systems in the construction of smart cities. Based on the machine learning and deep learning method, this paper is aimed at the passenger flow and traffic flow in the smart city transportation system. This paper deeply excavates the time, space, and other hidden features. In this paper, the traffic volume of the random sections in the city is predicted by using the graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) model, and the data are compared with the other five models (VAR, FNN, GCGRU, STGCN, and DGCNN). The experimental results show that compared with the other 4 models, the GCNN model has an increase of 8% to 10% accuracy and 15% fault tolerance. In forecasting morning and evening peak traffic flow, the accuracy of the GCNN model is higher than that of other models, and its trend is basically consistent with the actual traffic volume, the predicted results can reflect the actual traffic flow data well. Aimed at the application of intelligent transportation in an intelligent city, this paper proposes a machine learning prediction model based on big data, and this is of great significance for studying the mechanical learning of such problems.

Here, we propose a framework, ActivityNET, using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to predict passengers’ trip purpose from Smart Card (SC) data and Points-of-Interest (POIs) data. The feasibility of the framework is demonstrated in two phases. Phase I focuses on extracting activities from individuals’ daily travel patterns from smart card data and combining them with POIs using the proposed “activity-POIs consolidation algorithm”. Phase II feeds the extracted features into an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with multiple scenarios and predicts trip purpose under primary activities (home and work) and secondary activities (entertainment, eating, shopping, child drop-offs/pick-ups and part-time work) with high accuracy. As a case study, the proposed ActivityNET framework is applied in Greater London and illustrates a robust competence to predict trip purpose.

It is essential to identify, track and trace COVID-19 spread at its earliest detection. Timely action can not only reduce further spread but also help in providing an efficient medical response. Existing schemes rely on volunteer participation, and/or mobile traceability, which leads to delays in containing the spread. There is a need for an autonomous, connected, and centralized paradigm that can identify, trace and inform connected personals.

Therefore, the present study investigates the evidence of land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics and urban sprawl in Abha City of Saudi Arabia, which has been experiencing rapid urbanization, from the past to the future using novel and sophisticated methods. The SVM classifier was used in this study to classify the LULC maps for 1990, 2000, and 2018. The LULC dynamics between 1990-2000, 2000-2018, and 1990-2018 have been analyzed using delta (Δ) change and the Markovian transitional probability matrix. Urban sprawl or urban expansion was modeled using two approaches, such as landscape fragmentation and presence frequency for the first time. The future LULC map for 2028 was predicted using the artificial neural network-cellular automata model (ANN-CA). Future LULC was analyzed using landscape fragmentation and frequency approaches. The results of LULC maps showed that urban areas increased by 334.4% between 1990 and 2018. The Delta change rate showed that 16.34% in urban areas has increased since 1990. While, the transitional probability matrix between 1990 and 2018 reported that the built-up area is the largest stable LULC, having an 83.6% transitional probability value. While 17.9%, 21.8%, 12.4%, and 10.5% of agricultural land, scrubland, exposed rocks, and water bodies were transformed into built-up areas. Urban sprawl models showed that 139 km2 of new urban areas had been set up in 2018, 49 and 69 km2 in 1990 and 2000. Furthermore, in 2018, more than 200% of urban areas were stabilized or became core urban areas. The future LULC map (2028) showed that the built-up area would be 343.72 km2, followed by scrubland (342.98 km2) and sparse vegetation (89.96 km2). The new urban area in 2028 would be 169 km2.

Methodology: To present the state of the art in the development of monitoring technologies based on spatial and terrestrial platforms for the management of the urban forest, through the application of methods, techniques and technologies for monitoring, control and automation of survey and mapping processes, with views to decision making. Originality / Relevance: The production of this work is the presentation of different tools for urban forest management in an up-to-date manner, combining technological resources with the needs of public managers and, therefore, contributing to the quality of life of the urban population. Results: Some tools gaining notoriety due to their advantages in capturing information, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Remote sensing technologies have become mandatory tools in city management, urban and environmental planning. The analysis of vegetation in the urban area, distribution and classification carried out through the extraction of the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) is also used to characterize large areas and locate arboreal specimens with suspected deficiency in plant health. LiDAR sensors perform laser scanning, providing topographic and forest cover analyzes that make it possible to simultaneously map the terrain under the trees and its estimated height. Remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques are combined to map land use and land cover changes and assess the rate of urban expansion and vegetation loss. Other promising computational tools are Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning that proposes to develop devices that simulate the human capacity to reason, perceive, make decisions and solve problems.

The increased connectivity, referred to as hyper-connectivity, has led to the development of smart cities. People in these smart cities can access numerous online contents and are always connected. These developments, however, also lead to a lack of standardization and consistency in the propagation of information throughout communities due to the consumption of information through social media channels. Information cannot often be verified, which can confuse the users. The increasing influence of social media has thus led to the emergence and increasing prevalence of fake news. In this study, we propose a methodology to classify and identify fake news emanating from social channels. We collected content from Twitter to detect fake news and statistically verified that the temporal propagation pattern of quote retweets is effective for the classification of fake news. To verify this, we trained the temporal propagation pattern to a two-phases deep learning model based on convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory. The fake news classifier demonstrates the ability for its early detection. Moreover, it was verified that the temporal propagation pattern was the most influential feature compared to other feature groups discussed in this paper. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

Though many point processes have been proposed to model events in a continuous spatio-temporal space, none of them allow for the consideration of the rich contextual factors that affect event occurrence, such as weather, social activities, geographical characteristics, and traffic. In this paper, we propose DMPP (Deep Mixture Point Processes), a point process model for predicting spatio-temporal events with the use of rich contextual information; a key advance is its incorporation of the heterogeneous and high-dimensional context available in image and text data. Specifically, we design the intensity of our point process model as a mixture of kernels, where the mixture weights are modeled by a deep neural network. This formulation allows us to automatically learn the complex nonlinear effects of the contextual factors on event occurrence. At the same time, this formulation makes analytical integration over the intensity, which is required for point process estimation, tractable. We use real-world data sets from different domains to demonstrate that DMPP has better predictive performance than existing methods. © 2021, Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence.

However, some problems may occur such as the irregular distribution of bikes on related stations/racks/areas, and the difficulty of knowing in advance what the rack status will be like, or predicting if there will be bikes available in a specific bike-station at a certain time of the day, or if there will be a free slot to leave the rented bike. Thus, providing predictions can be useful to improve the service quality, especially in those cases where bike racks are used for e-bikes, which need to be recharged. This paper compares the state-of-the-art techniques to predict the number of available bikes and free bike-slots in bike-sharing stations (i.e., bike racks). To this end, a set of features and predictive models were compared to identify the best models and predictors for short-term predictions, namely of 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes. The study has demonstrated that deep learning and in particular Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks (Bi-LSTM) offers a robust approach for the implementation of reliable and fast predictions of available bikes, even with a limited amount of historical data.

Representing the recent rapid development of drone technology, UAVs have been widely used in fifth-generation (5G) cellular networks and the Internet of Things (IoT), such as drone aerial photography, express drone delivery, and drone traffic supervision. However, owing to low altitude and low speed, drones can only limitedly monitor and detect small target objects, resulting in frequent intrusion and collision. Traditional methods of monitoring the safety of drones are mostly expensive and difficult to implement. In smart city construction, a large number of smart IoT cameras connected to 5G networks are installed in the city. Captured drone images are transmitted to the cloud via a high-speed and low-latency 5G network, and machine learning algorithms are used for target detection and tracking. In this study, we propose a method for real-time tracking of drone targets by using the existing monitoring network to obtain drone images in real time and employing deep learning methods by which drones in urban environments can be guided. To achieve real-time tracking of UAV targets, we employed the tracking-by-detection mode in machine learning, with the network-modified YOLOv3 (you only look once v3) as the target detector and Deep SORT as the target tracking correlation algorithm. We established a drone tracking dataset that contains four types of drones and 2800 pictures in different environments. The tracking model we trained achieved 94.4% tracking accuracy in real-time UAV target tracking and a tracking speed of 54 FPS. These results comprehensively demonstrate that our tracking model achieves high-precision real-time UAV target tracking at a reduced cost. © 2021 Tao Hong et al.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114592632,Yes,China,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,Deep Learning,Tracking,Develop a multitarget real-time tracking algorithm for UAV IoT applications,"SDG 9, SDG 11",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

Precise controlling and management of traffic conditions, increased safety and surveillance, and enhanced incident avoidance and management should be top priorities in smart city management. At the same time, Vehicle License Plate Number Recognition (VLPNR) has become a hot research topic, owing to several real-time applications like automated toll fee processing, traffic law enforcement, private space access control, and road traffic surveillance. Automated VLPNR is a computer vision-based technique which is employed in the recognition of automobiles based on vehicle number plates. The current research paper presents an effective Deep Learning (DL)-based VLPNR called DL-VLPNR model to identify and recognize the alphanumeric characters present in license plate. The proposed model involves two main stages namely, license plate detection and Tesseract-based character recognition. The detection of alphanumeric characters present in license plate takes place with the help of fast RCNN with Inception V2 model. Then, the characters in the detected number plate are extracted using Tesseract Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model. The performance of DL-VLPNR model was tested in this paper using two benchmark databases, and the experimental outcome established the superior performance of the model compared to other methods. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

Furthermore, urban city mobility is a key differentiator for competitiveness which continues to move to have a more dynamic economy and draw greater domestic investment. Subsequently, workforce optimisation for urban transportation using deep learning as an essential artificial intelligence branch provides knowledge for a computer system to identify, predict, and make decisions by analysing the data relevant to the application deployed.

Several successful results have shown that deep learning technologies might provide an effective way to predict the number of passengers at a metro station. However, most information systems based on deep learning technologies are usually designed and tuned manually by using domain knowledge and trial-and-error; thus, how to find out a set of suitable hyperparameters for a deep neural network (DNN) has become a critical research issue. To deal with the problem of hyperparameter setting for a DNN in solving the prediction of passengers at a metro station, a novel metaheuristic algorithm called search economics for hyperparameter optimization is presented to improve the accuracy rate of such a prediction system. The basic idea of the proposed algorithm is to divide the solution space into a set of subspaces first and then assign a different number of search agents to each subspace based on the ""potential of each subspace.""The potential is estimated based on the objective values of the searched solutions, the objective values of the probe solutions, and the computation time invested in each subspace. The proposed method is compared with Bayesian, random forest, support vector regression, DNN, and DNN with different hyperparameter search algorithms, namely, grid search, simulated annealing, and particle swarm optimization. The simulation results using the data provided by the government of Taipei city, Taiwan, indicate that the proposed method outperforms all the other forecasting methods compared in this article in terms of the mean absolute percentage error. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.","This work was supported in part by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan, R.O.C., under Contracts No. MOST107-2218-E-005-018 and No. MOST108-2221-E-005-021-MY3.

Although MobileNet v1 is generally known to be much faster but less accurate than ResNet50, it is necessary to ana-lyze the performances of whole PoseNet models carefully and select one of them suitable for the AIoT edge device. For this reason, we first investigate the computational complexity of the models about their neural network layers and parameters and then compare their performances in terms of inference time, frame rate and pose score. We found that the model with MobileNet v1 could estimate human poses very fast without significant pose score degradation when compared with the model with ResNet-50 through some experimental results. In addition, the model with MobileNet v1 could smoothly handle video clips with 480 × 360 and 640 × 480 resolutions as inputs except 1280 × 720 resolution. Finally, we implemented the overall oneM2M-compliant system with an AIoT edge device containing the model with MobileNet v1 and a floating population monitoring server, which is applicable to commercial area analysis in a smart city and we verified its operation and feasibility by periodically displaying all the data of temperature, humidity, illuminance, and floating population estimation from the AIoT edge device on a map in a web browser. © 2021, Tech Science Press.

Thus, establishing a land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) prediction and simulation model is of great significance for understanding the process of urban change and assessing its ecological impact. In previous studies, LUCC prediction models have been mainly based on cellular automata structures that calculate a future state pixel by pixel through transition rules. Because these transition rules are usually based on the global state and each pixel is calculated according to these fixed rules, the results of these methods have room for improvement in terms of generating details and heterogeneity. In this article, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based LUCC prediction model using multiscale local spatial information is proposed. The model is based on a pix2pix GAN and an attention structure that predicts future land use through multiscale local spatial information. To validate our model, Shenzhen, a region that is experiencing rapid urbanization, was chosen as the source of the experimental data.

According to the UN report, at the end of 2050, more than half of the rural population will be moved to urban areas. With such an increase, urban areas will face new health, education, Transport, and ecological issues. To overcome such kinds of issues, the world is moving towards smart cities. Cities cannot be smart without using Cloud computing platforms, the Internet of Things (IoT). The world has seen such incredible and brilliant ideas for rural areas and smart cities. While considering the Ecosystem in Smart Cities, there is a considerable requirement to improve the model to make life better. This proposed research integrates a city into a smart city using the Internet of Things (IoT) which focuses on the smart ecosystem. In this research work, a model is proposed to overcome an ecosystem’s IoT and Machine Learning techniques issues. The LevenbergMarquardt (LM), Bayesian Regularization (BR), and the Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG) algorithms are implemented with an ANN-based approach named to empower the ecosystem of the smart city while developing an efficient and smart ecosystem model.

One of the key challenges, however, is the strain on power grid infrastructure that comes with large-scale EV deployment. The solution to this lies in utilization of smart scheduling algorithms to manage the growing public charging demand. Using data-driven tools and machine learning algorithms to learn the EV charging behavior can improve scheduling algorithms. Researchers have focused on using historical charging data for predictions of behavior such as departure time and energy needs. However, variables such as weather, traffic, and nearby events, which have been neglected to a large extent, can perhaps add meaningful representations, and provide better predictions. Therefore, in this paper we propose the usage of historical charging data in conjunction with weather, traffic, and events data to predict EV session duration and energy consumption using popular machine learning algorithms including random forest, SVM, XGBoost and deep neural networks. The best predictive performance is achieved by an ensemble learning model, with SMAPE scores of 9.9% and 11.6% for session duration and energy consumptions, respectively, which improves upon the existing works in the literature. In both predictions, we demonstrate a significant improvement compared to previous work on the same dataset and we highlight the importance of traffic and weather information for charging behavior predictions. © 2013 IEEE.","This work was supported by the Computer Science and Engineering Department and the Open Access Program from the American University of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112242405,Yes,United Arab Emirates,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,Machine Learning,Prediction/Forecasting,Predict EV charging behavior using machine learning for smart transportation,"SDG 7, SDG 11",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

Machine learning enables predictive spatial-monitoring by using a large amount of aggregated sensor data. Since the capacity of mobile networks is strictly limited, serious transmission delays occur when loads of communication traffic are heavy. If some of the data used for predictive spatial-monitoring do not arrive on time, prediction accuracy degrades because the prediction has to be done using only the received data, which implies that data for prediction are 'delay-sensitive'. A utility-based allocation technique has suggested modeling of temporal characteristics of such delay-sensitive data for prioritized transmission. However, no study has addressed temporal model for prioritized transmission in predictive spatial-monitoring. Therefore, this paper proposes a scheme that enables the creation of a temporal model for predictive spatial-monitoring. The scheme is roughly composed of two steps: the first involves creating training data from original time-series data and a machine learning model that can use the data, while the second step involves modeling a temporal model using feature selection in the learning model. Feature selection enables the estimation of the importance of data in terms of how much the data contribute to prediction accuracy from the machine learning model. This paper considers road-traffic prediction as a scenario and shows that the temporal models created with the proposed scheme can handle real spatial datasets. A numerical study demonstrated how our temporal model works effectively in prioritized transmission for predictive spatial-monitoring in terms of prediction accuracy. © © 2021 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers","This work was supported in part by JST PRESTO Grant no.

To perform this task, the low-level features including shape, texture, and color information are extracted and represented in symbolic forms. In this work, a methodology is proposed, which extracts the salient features and properties using machine learning techniques and represent this information as Linked Data using a domain ontology that is explicitly tailored for detection of certain activities. An ontology is also developed to include concepts and properties which may be applicable in the domain of surveillance and its applications. The proposed approach is validated with actual implementation and is thus evaluated by recognizing suspicious activity in an open parking space. The suspicious activity detection is formalized through inference rules and SPARQL queries. Eventually, Semantic Web Technology has proven to be a remarkable toolchain to interpret videos, thus opening novel possibilities for video scene representation, and detection of complex events, without any human involvement. The proposed novel approach can thus have representation of frame-level information of a video in structured representation and perform event detection while reducing storage and enhancing semantically-aided retrieval of video data. © 2021 - IOS Press.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85111984896,Yes,India,Security/Surveillance,Security & Safety,Urban Resilience & Safety,"Machine Learning, Ontology",Detection,Develop video representation and suspicious event detection using semantic technologies,"SDG 11, SDG 16",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

We compare the performance of our FSF architecture on the problem of forecasting IoT device traffic against the following existing (feature selection, forecasting) technique pairs: Autocorrelation Function (ACF), Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Recurrent Feature Elimination (RFE) and Ridge Regression methods for feature selection, and Linear Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), 1 Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Logistic Regression for forecasting.

Electrified vehicle sharing systems are even more effective in terms of reducing fuel consumption and carbon emission. In this article, we investigate a dynamic fleet management problem for an Electric Vehicle (EV) sharing system that faces time-varying random demand and electricity price. Demand is elastic in each time period, reacting to the announced price. To maximize the revenue, the EV fleet optimizes trip pricing and EV dispatching decisions dynamically. We develop a new value function approximation with input convex neural networks to generate high-quality solutions. Through a New York City case study, we compare it with standard dynamic programming methods and develop insights regarding the interaction between the EV fleet and the power grid. © Copyright © 2021 “IISE”.",This research is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation through Grants CNS# 1637772.

The city government can respond in advance based on gather predictions and greatly reduce the loss and risks caused by vicious gatherings. Compared with other trajectory prediction tasks (i.e., the recommendation of point of interest), gather prediction pay more attention to real-time trajectory data and requests stronger spatial-temporal dependence. At the same time, gather prediction is more focused on scenes with multiple types of trajectories. And the existing methods majorly rely on the trajectory data and ignore the great influence of geographical environment (i.e., road network structure). Therefore, this paper transforms the gather prediction into the trajectory prediction task with strong real-time condition in a certain city and conducts the gathering situations by predicting users' aggregated movements in next minutes or hours. A novel Spatiotemporal Gate Recurrent Unit (STGRU) model is proposed, where spatiotemporal gates and road network gate are introduced to capture the spatiotemporal relationships between trajectories. Compared with existing methods, we improve the performance of the model by adding road network structure and external knowledges, as well as time and distance gates to reduce model parameters. The proposed STGRU is evaluated on three real-world trajectory datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. © 2021 Mingchao Yuan et al.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85111654058,Yes,China,Security/Surveillance,Security & Safety,Urban Resilience & Safety,GRU,Prediction/Forecasting,Develop a road network enhanced GRU model for gather prediction in smart cities,"SDG 11, SDG 16",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

Besides the focus on technological innovations within information and communication technology, artificial intelligence, internet of things, new infrastructures and Big Data, smart cities are also about economic, sociocultural, architectural, ecological and political changes. As Engelbert et al. (2018) argue, citizens represent different interests and needs that are rarely stated in smart city discourse. According to Sangiuliano (2014), smart cities are generally not attentive to gender inequalities and, as Rose (2016) has pointed out, smart city conferences – both academic and professional – are dominated by men. Feminist urban scholars, scrutinizing patriarchal urban development, raise questions of how to develop an inclusive smart city and whether it is possible to claim the concept of smart cities for a more inclusive city. In this article, adding to earlier feminist urban theorists and intersectional approaches, we want to turn to the methodological challenges on how to investigate and 'unpack' power relations within smart city visions and materializations. We argue that there is a need for an increased methodological awareness within the smart city research in order to include social difference. © 2021, ACME.

With the widespread use of smart interactive devices and systems, the exponential growth of data volume and the complex modeling requirements increase the difficulty of deep learning modeling, and the classical centralized deep learning modeling scheme has encountered bottlenecks in the improvement of model performance and the diversification of smart application scenarios. The parallel processing system in deep learning links the virtual information space with the physical world, although the distributed deep learning research has become a crucial concern with its unique advantages in training efficiency, and improving the availability of trained models and preventing privacy disclosure are still the main challenges faced by related research. To address these above issues in distributed deep learning, this research developed a clonal selective optimization system based on the federated learning framework for the model training process involving large-scale data. This system adopts the heuristic clonal selective strategy in local model optimization and optimizes the effect of federated training. First of all, this process enhances the adaptability and robustness of the federated learning scheme and improves the modeling performance and training efficiency. Furthermore, this research attempts to improve the privacy security defense capability of the federated learning scheme for big data through differential privacy preprocessing.

As a result, the prediction of parking occupancy has sparked significant research interest in recent years. While many external data sources have been considered in the prediction models, the underlying geographic context has mostly been ignored. Thus, in order to study the contribution of geospatial information to parking occupancy prediction models, road network centrality, land use, and Point of Interest (POI) data were incorporated in Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN, specifically Feedforward Neural Network FFNN) prediction models in this work. Model performances were compared to a baseline, which only considers historical and temporal input data. Moreover, the influence of the amount of training data, the prediction horizon, and the spatial variation of the prediction were explored. The results show that the inclusion of geospatial information led to a performance improvement of up to 25% compared to the baseline. Besides, as the prediction horizon expanded, predictions became less reliable, while the relevance of geospatial data increased. In general, land use and POI data proved to be more beneficial than road network centrality. The amount of training data did not have a significant influence on the performance of the RF model. The ANN model, conversely, achieved optimal results on a training input of 5 days. Likely attributable to varying occupancy patterns, prediction performance disparities could be identified for different parking districts and street segments. Generally, the RF model outperformed the ANN model on all predictions. © 2021 Wuhan University.

Then we defined seven residential districts in Berlin, according to their spatial distributions and construction periods. Through a systematic comparison of perceptual qualities of the seven residential districts, we find perceptual qualities of ecology and enclosure have been improved a lot over a hundred years in Berlin. The housing policies and design codes in different social, economic and political contexts evolved to end overcrowding living conditions, create more open spaces, and develop a better ecological environment. This study enriches our understanding and application of subjective measures of human-centred built environment perception to the evolution of the historical urban landscape. The proposed quantitative framework of subjective human perception measures provides great testimony to evaluate the effects of the implementation of housing and other urban planning policies. Such an automated, multisource, high-throughput and scalable framework can be applied to other cities to determine the personality of the city and assess the impact of urban design and planning policies in streetscape improvement. © Wichmann Verlag, VDE VERLAG GMBH ·.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85110528788,Yes,United States,Urban Planning,Urban Planning & Land Use,Urban Development & Land Use,"Computer Vision, Machine Learning",Analysis,Analyze evolution of historical urban landscape using computer vision and machine learning,SDG 11,Empirical,Mixed,Local,Past,Longitudinal,Strong

To date, most of the research on ecological security is based on the pressure-state-response (PSR) model, while there were a few studies based on the landscape ecology model approach. In addition, there has been little literature focus on the dynamic change process of ecological security, especially the simulation and prediction of the future development trend of ecological security. The purpose of this research is to establish a landscape ecological security evaluation method based on grid division, be aimed at breaking the inherent drawbacks of the administrative region as a unit mode approach, anticipated to better reflect the landscape ecological security status of the study area. A complex framework was constructed by integrating random forest algorithm, Fishnet model, landscape ecology model, and CA-Markov model. Multitemporal remote sensing data were selected as a data source, and land use maps of the study area were obtained through the random forest machine learning algorithm firstly. And then, the study area is divided into 307 grids of 2 km×2 km using the Fishnet model. Next, the landscape disturbance index, landscape vulnerability index, and landscape loss index are used on the grid scale to establish a landscape ecological security evaluation model. Finally, ecological security assessment of Zhengzhou city was carried out, and the distribution map of the landscape ecological status in 1986, 1996, 2006, 2016, and predicted for 2026 was obtained. The results of the study showed that, as time goes by, the areas with high ecological safety gradually decrease. It is predicted that by 2026, the ecological security level of Zhengzhou will be dominated by lower ecological security areas. The research results can provide basic information and decision support for government agencies and land use planners to ensure responsible and sustainable development of the urban environment and ecology. © 2021 Pei Liu et al.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85110216847,Yes,China,Environment/Pollution,Environment & Sustainability,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Remote Sensing,Analysis,Assess ecological security based on remote sensing and landscape ecology model,"SDG 11, SDG 15",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Longitudinal,Strong

The development of these cities is supposed to bring India as a smart India in the global market. With all odds in favor; these projects are not gaining their expected on-time results. This has motivated us to think that there are loopholes that are putting hindrance to smart cities development. The aim of this study is to identify and prioritize mathematically the key barriers using the neutrosophic PESTEL analysis technique. An extensive literature survey of the problem provides a lot of factors which are categorized in six main factors such as social, political, legal, ethical and technological factors. Present work using neutrosophic PESTEL analysis finds that social and political factors with 93% and 83% are the key barriers to the development of smart cities in India. Other factors such as Technological and economic factors come at second position securing percentage 75% and 60% respectively. Environmental and legal factors come at last securing 49% and 43% respectively. The research’s main focus is to identify and prioritize quantitatively the most important barriers which come into smart cities development in India.

Many vehicles access the network randomly and handover frequently between access Base Stations (BS), so the flexibility and scalability of the network architecture are required for the IoV network. SDN is a centralized network architecture that has obtained a lot of attention in the IoV. Vehicles share information through the IoV network, and vehicles have high requirements for the real-time and bandwidth of shared information. Network traffic estimation is very important for network management, load balancing, and network planning. The estimation results can be used to improve the quality of service of operators. To estimate the network traffic accuracy and efficiency, we use the Wavelet Decomposition (WD) method to decompose the signal into the Low- and High- frequency component. The low-frequency component of network traffic describes the smoothness and long-range correlation of network traffic, we train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to estimate it. Otherwise, the high-frequency component of the network traffic fluctuates strongly which shows the randomness of the network traffic, we model the network traffic as an exponential distribution. However, there are differences between estimation results and actual network traffic, so we propose an objective function to optimize the network traffic estimation to reduce the errors.

The increase in the number of devices connected to the Internet of things (IoT) is nearly beyond imagination. These devices are communicating with each other and facilitating human life. The connection of these devices has provided opening directions for the smart applications which are one of the growing areas of research. Among these opportunities, security and privacy are considered to be one of the major issues for researchers to tackle. Proper security measures can prevent attackers from interrupting the security of IoT network inside the smart city for secure data traffic. Keeping in view the security consideration of data traffic for smart devices and IoT, the proposed study presented machine learning algorithms for securing the data traffic based on a firewall for smart devices and IoT network. The study has used the dataset of ""Firewall""for validation purposes. The experimental results of the approach show that the hybrid deep learning model (based on convolution neural network and support vector machine) outperforms than decision1 rules and random forest by generating a recognition rate of 95.5% for the hybrid model, 68.5% for decision rules, and 78.3% accuracy for random forest. The validity of the proposed model is also tested based on other performance metrics such as f score, error rate, recall, and precision.

With the recent development of AI and IoT technologies, it is possible for deep learning techniques to achieve more accurate energy generation forecasting results for the PV systems. Difficulties exist for the traditional PV energy generation forecasting method considering external feature variables, such as the seasonality. In this study, we propose a hybrid deep learning method that combines the clustering techniques, convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and attention mechanism with the wireless sensor network to overcome the existing difficulties of the PV energy generation forecasting problem. The overall proposed method is divided into three stages, namely, clustering, training, and forecasting.

In the training stage, a convolutional neural network, long short-term memory neural network, and attention mechanism are combined to construct a hybrid deep learning model to perform the forecasting task. In the testing stage, the most appropriate training model is selected based on the month of the testing data.

The accurate prediction of taxi flow provides an attractive way to find the potential traffic hotspots in the city, which helps to avoid serious traffic congestions by taking effective measures in advance. The current prediction of taxi flow and its impact on urban transportation are closely related to the passenger origin-destination (OD) information. However, high-quality OD information is not always available. To address this problem, a prediction model, named as TaxiInt, is proposed in this study. Different from other density-clustering-based approaches, neural network, or OD information based models, TaxiInt predicted the taxi flow using the trajectory data of taxis.

Unfortunately, deploying DNN at resource-constrained edge devices poses a huge challenge. These workloads are computationally intensive. Moreover, the edge server-based approach may be affected by incidental factors, such as network jitters and conflicts, when multiple tasks are offloaded to the same device. A rational workload scheduling for smart environments is highly desired. In this work, we propose a Conflict-resilient Incremental Offloading of Deep Neural Networks at Edge (CIODE) for improving the efficiency of DNN inference in the edge smart environment. CIODE divides the DNN model into several partitions by layer and incrementally uploads them to local edge nodes. We design a waiting lock-based scheduling paradigm to choose edge devices for DNN layers to be offloaded. In detail, an advanced lock mechanism is proposed to handle concurrency conflicts. Real-world testbed-based experiments demonstrate that, compared with other state-of-the-art baselines, CIODE outperforms the DNN inference performance of these popular baselines by 20% to 70% and significantly improves the robustness under the insight of neighboring collaboration. © 2021 Zhongmin Chen et al.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85108458590,Yes,China,ICT Infrastructure,Smart City Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"DNN, Edge Computing",Optimization,Develop conflict-resilient incremental offloading of DNNs to the edge in smart environments,"SDG 9, SDG 11",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

Our living comfortability level has been improved. Such technology requires extensive data processing especially when it is a real time driven data. Apache Hadoop framework is a necessary and efficient model that can be incorporated with the IoT technology. Hadoop, the open-source framework, is typically used for off-line batch processing on largescale clusters. It has a wide range of applications in the big data industry due to its capability in processing massive data in distributed and parallel environments. However, several aspects should be carefully evaluated before deploying Hadoop-based solutions. The authors thoroughly investigate the Apache Hadoop framework with the focus on factors that directly affect its performance. The work discusses and evaluates two crucial dimensions of Hadoop systems; monitoring tools and their impact on the performance of the Apache Hadoop based clusters, and the most influential parameters and the optimization techniques of Apache Hadoop based systems. Results showed that monitoring tools play a major role in Hadoop-based solutions planning and maintenance. According to the used experimental settings, the Cacti monitoring tool consumes around 45% of the memory usage, however memory usage in Ganglia is more efficient than Cacti tool (i.e., on average around 2.5%). For CPU utilization, both monitoring tools are efficient and the monitoring tool usage amount is almost negligible. The results also showed that there is a shortlist of critical parameters that significantly affect the overall performance. Based on the results, the authors conclude the paper by future directions and possible improvements that need further explorations and experiments. © 2021 Little Lion Scientific.

By fusing object detection algorithms, video keyframe selection algorithms, and super-resolution reconstruction algorithms, we proposed a deep learning-based intelligent video detection object super-resolution (SR) method. Secondly, we designed a regression-based object detection algorithm and a key video frame selection algorithm. The object detection algorithm is used to assist police and security personnel to track suspicious objects in real time. The keyframe selection algorithm can select key information from a large amount of redundant information, which helps to improve the efficiency of video content analysis and reduce labor costs. Finally, we designed an asymmetric depth recursive back-projection network for super-resolution reconstruction. By combining the advantages of the pixel-based super-resolution algorithm and the feature space-based super-resolution algorithm, we improved the resolution and the visual perception clarity of the key objects. Extensive experimental evaluations show the efficiency and effectiveness of our method. © 2021 Sheng Ren et al.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107800445,Yes,China,Security/Surveillance,Security & Safety,Urban Resilience & Safety,Deep Fusion Network,Super-Resolution,Develop efficient video detection object super-resolution with deep fusion network for public security,"SDG 11, SDG 16",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

The selection of the appropriate solution, which is considered the best compromise among the candidates, is known as complex problem-solving. Smart city administrators face different problems of complex nature, such as optimal energy trading in microgrids and optimal comfort index in smart homes, to mention a few. This paper proposes a novel architecture to offer complex problem solutions as a service (CPSaaS) based on predictive model optimization and optimal task orchestration to offer solutions to different problems in a smart city. Predictive model optimization uses a machine learning module and optimization objective to compute the given problem’s solutions. The task orchestration module helps decompose the complex problem in small tasks and deploy them on real-world physical sensors and actuators. The proposed architecture is hierarchical and modular, making it robust against faults and easy to maintain. The proposed architecture’s evaluation results highlight its strengths in fault tolerance, accuracy, and processing speed. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

There are many techniques to support the aforementioned applications, but for privacy preservation of Cloud 5G, the existing methods are still not sufficient. Public key encryption (PKE) scheme is an important means to protect user data privacy in Cloud 5G. Currently, the most common PKE used in Cloud 5G is CCA or CPA secure ones. However, its security level maybe not enough. SOA security is a stronger security standard than CPA and CCA. Roughly speaking, PKE with SOA security means that the adversary is allowed to open a subset of challenger ciphertexts and obtains the corresponding encrypted messages and randomness, but the unopended messages and randomness remain secure in the rest of the challenger ciphertexts. Security against SOA in PKEs has been a research hotspot, especially with the wide discussion in Cloud 5G.

This study proposes a remote sensing and data-driven solution for urban green space detection at regional scale via employment of state-of-the-art metaheuristic and machine learning approaches. Remotely sensed data obtained from Sentinel 2 satellite in the study area of Da Nang city (Vietnam) are used to construct and verify an intelligent model that hybridizes Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA) and support vector machines (SVM). SVM are employed to generalize a decision boundary that separates features characterizing statistical measurements of remote sensing data into two categories of ""green space""and ""nongreen space"". The MPA metaheuristic is used to optimize the SVM training phase by identifying an appropriate set of the SVM's hyperparameters including the penalty coefficient and the kernel function parameter. Experimental results show that the proposed model which processes information provided by all of the Sentinel 2 satellite's spectral bands can deliver a better performance than those obtained from the model based on vegetation indices. With a good classification accuracy rate of roughly 93%, an F1 score = 0.93, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic = 0.98, the newly developed model is a promising tool to assist local authority to obtain up-to-date information on urban green space and develop plans of sustainable urban land use. © 2021 Nhat-Duc Hoang and Xuan-Linh Tran.",This research was funded by the Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant no. 105.99-2019.339.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107601541,Yes,Vietnam,Environment/Pollution,Environment & Sustainability,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,"Marine Predators Algorithm, SVM",Detection,Detect urban green space using marine predators algorithm optimized machine learning,"SDG 11, SDG 15",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

Short-term traffic flow prediction is one of the challenging tasks of traffic situation awareness, which is useful for route planning, traffic congestion alleviation, emission reduction, and so on. Over the past few years, ubiquitous location acquisition techniques and sensors digitized the road networks and generated spatiotemporal data. Massive traffic data provide an opportunity for short-term traffic flow prediction in a data-driven manner. Most of the existing short-term traffic flow prediction methods can be divided into two categories: nonparametric and parametric. Traditional parametric methods failed to obtain accurate prediction, due to the nonlinear and stochastic characteristics of short-term traffic flow. Recently, deep learning methods have been studied widely in the fields of short-term prediction. These nonparametric methods yielded promising results in practical experiments. Motivated by the current study status, we dedicate this paper to a short-term traffic flow prediction approach based on the recurrent mixture density network, the combination of recurrent neural network (RNN), and mixture density network (MDN). This approach is implemented on real-world traffic flow data and demonstrates the prominent superiority. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the recurrent mixture density network is applied to a real-world short-term traffic flow prediction task. © 2021 Mingjian Chen et al.",This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 42074013).,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107545702,Yes,China,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,Recurrent Mixture Density Network,Prediction/Forecasting,Develop short-term traffic flow prediction with recurrent mixture density network,SDG 11,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

Nearly 150 thousand people are affected by the road accidents that must be minimized, and improving safety is required in VANET. The prediction of traffic congestions plays a momentous role in minimizing accidents in roads and improving traffic management for people. However, the dynamic behavior of the vehicles in the network degrades the rendition of deep learning models in predicting the traffic congestion on roads. To overcome the congestion problem, this paper proposes a new hybrid boosted long short-term memory ensemble (BLSTME) and convolutional neural network (CNN) model that ensemble the powerful features of CNN with BLSTME to negotiate the dynamic behavior of the vehicle and to predict the congestion in traffic effectively on roads. The CNN extracts the features from traffic images, and the proposed BLSTME trains and strengthens the weak classifiers for the prediction of congestion. The proposed model is developed using Tensor flow python libraries and are tested in real traffic scenario simulated using SUMO and OMNeT++. The extensive experimentations are carried out, and the model is measured with the performance metrics likely prediction accuracy, precision, and recall. Thus, the experimental result shows 98% of accuracy, 96% of precision, and 94% of recall.

Although they perform important functions, research focuses on large cities and metropolises while marginalizing small cities, the study of which is of great importance to progress in social sciences, geography, and urban planning. The main goal of this paper was to verify the impact of selected socio-economic factors on the share of built-up areas in 665 small Polish cities in 2019. Data from the Database of Topographic Objects (BDOT), Sentinel-2 satellite imagery from 2015 and 2019, and Local Data Bank by Statistics Poland form 2019 were used in the research. A machine learning segmentation procedure was used to obtain the data on the occurrence of built-up areas. Hot Spot (Getis-Ord Gi*) analysis and geographically weighted regression (GWR) was applied to explain spatially varying impact of factors related to population, spatial and economic development, and living standards on the share of built-up areas in the area of small cities. Significant association was found between the population density and the share of built-up areas in the area of the cities studied. The influence of the other socio-economic factors examined, related to the spatial and economic development of the cities and the quality of life of the inhabitants, showed great regional variation. The results also indicated that the share of built-up areas in the area of the cities under study is a result of the conditions under which they were established and developed throughout their existence, and not only of the socio-economic factors affecting them at present. © 2021 by the authors.

The model was tested in Amol City, Iran, a data-scarce city in an ungauged area which is prone to severe flood inundation events and currently lacks flood prevention infrastructure. Performance of the hybridized model was compared with that of a standalone MLPNN model, random forest and boosted regression trees. Area under the curve, efficiency, true skill statistic, Matthews correlation coefficient, misclassification rate, sensitivity and specificity were used to evaluate model performance. In validation, the MultiB-MLPNN model showed the best predictive performance. The hybridized MultiB-MLPNN model is thus useful for generating realistic flood susceptibility maps for data-scarce urban areas. The maps can be used to develop risk-reduction measures to protect urban areas from devastating floods, particularly where available data are insufficient to support physically based hydrological or hydraulic models. © 2021 The Author(s).

However, the large and complex network of the system leads to several problems: the system consumes a huge amount of energy; the subsystems cannot exchange information smoothly; it is difficult to update or optimize the system. To solve these problems, this paper designs a WSN-based low-power monitoring system for smart city roads. Specifically, the functional requirements of the road monitoring system for smart city were fully analyzed, and the architecture of the system was designed in functional dimensions of networked sharing platform, monitoring system data flows, and cloud storage database. After that, the authors analyzed the energy consumption of WSN, quantified the topological parameters, and realized the low-power design based on the energy-saving technique of data compression and sleep/wake-up. The proposed energy-saving strategy was proved effective through experiments. © 2021, Aracne Editrice.

To this end, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks, Markov chain model, GIS and TerrSet software package were used. Initially, nine driving variables affecting the future development of the city were identified. Then, using the maximum probability estimation model, land uses were classified into six categories in the MMA with an area of 8819.6 km2 for 2014, 2017 and 2020. During 2014–2020, two land uses have experienced positive changes (residential and cultivated land uses with 16.48% and 11.56% respectively) and four of them (forest cover with −5.74%, grass and green space with −9.72%, barren lands with −11.14% and water body with −1.45%) have experienced a decrease in area. To validate the prediction of land use changes until 2030, the kappa coefficient (0.617) was used. The result of using Cramer's V statistics (above 0.15) to measure the effect of driving variables on land use forecast was acceptable. LULC change was predicted by MLP and Markov chain model for 2030. The results showed that two land uses (residential and industrial land use with 26.3% and cultivated land with 6.99%) will have positive change and four of them (forest coverage with −17.11%, barren land with −9 29%, grass and green space with −5.33% and water bodies with −1.38%) should have negative growth. Spatial changes of land use will occur mostly in the northern and north-western regions on barren land, and on the east and southeast on forest and green spaces. Findings are useful for planning authorities in MMA where it is highly affected by population growth and LULC change. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",I would like to thank the honourable anonymous reviewers who carefully read the article and made valuable suggestions and constructive feedback that helped to improve the quality of the article.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105990811,Yes,Iran,Land Use/Zoning,Urban Planning & Land Use,Urban Development & Land Use,"MLP Neural Networks, Markov Chain",Prediction/Forecasting,Simulate land use land cover change in Melbourne metropolitan area using MLP and Markov chain,"SDG 11, SDG 15",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

Although traffic density reduction inside the city was felt subjectively, there has thus far been no objective and quantitative study of its variation to reflect the intracity population flows and their corresponding relationship with lockdown policy stringency from the view of remote sensing (RS) images with the high resolution under 1 m. Accordingly, we here provide a quantitative investigation of the traffic density reduction before and after lockdown was implemented in six cities (Wuhan, Milan, Madrid, Paris, New York, and London) around the world heavily affected by the COVID-19 epidemic, which is accomplished by extracting vehicles from the multitemporal high-resolution RS images. A novel vehicle detection model combining unsupervised vehicle candidate extraction and deep learning identification was specifically proposed for the images with the resolution of 0.5 m. Our results indicate that traffic densities were reduced by an average of approximately 50% (and as much as 75.96%) in these six cities following lockdown. The influences on traffic density reduction rates are also highly correlated with policy stringency, with an ${{\boldsymbol{R}}^2}$ value exceeding 0.83. Even within a specific city, the traffic density changes differed and tended to be distributed in accordance with the city's land-use patterns. Considering that public transport was mostly reduced or even forbidden, our results indicate that city lockdown policies are effective at limiting human transmission within cities. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Manuscript received January 10, 2021; revised April 14, 2021; accepted April 21, 2021.

One such application is the Internet of Vehicles whichmonitors the roadside traffic for automating traffic rules. As vehicles are connected to the internet through wireless communication technologies, the Internet of Vehicles network infrastructure is susceptible to flooding attacks. Reconfiguring the network infrastructure is difficult as network customization is not possible. As Software Defined Network provide a flexible programming environment for network customization, detecting flooding attacks on the Internet of Vehicles is integrated on top of it. The basic methodology used is crypto-fuzzy rules, in which cryptographic standard is incorporated in the traditional fuzzy rules. In this research work, an intelligent framework for secure transportation is proposed with the basic ideas of security attacks on the Internet of Vehicles integrated with software-defined networking. The intelligent framework is proposed to apply for the smart city application. The proposed cognitive framework is integrated with traditional fuzzy, cryptofuzzy andRestricted BoltzmannMachine algorithm to detect malicious traffic flows in Software-Defined-Internet of Vehicles. It is inferred from the result interpretations that an intelligent framework for secure transportation system achieves better attack detection accuracy with less delay and also prevents buffer overflow attacks.

Trust management (TM) has always been a challenging issue in a vehicular network. One such developing network is the Internet of vehicles (IoV), which is expected to be an essential part of smart cities. IoV originated from the merger of Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET) and the Internet of things (IoT). Security is one of the main barriers in the on-road IoV implementation. Existing security standards are insufficient to meet the extremely dynamic and rapidly changing IoV requirements. Trust plays a vital role in ensuring security, especially during vehicle to vehicle communication. Vehicular networks, having a unique nature among other wireless ad hoc networks, require dedicated efforts to develop trust protocols. Current TM schemes are inflexible and static. Predefined scenarios and limited parameters are the basis for existing TMmodels that are not suitable for vehicle networks. The vehicular network requires agile and adaptive solutions to ensure security, especially when it comes to critical messages. The vehicle network's wireless nature increases its attack surface and exposes the network to numerous security threats. Moreover, internet involvement makes it more vulnerable to cyberattacks. The proposedTMframework is based on context-based cognition and machine learning to be best suited to IoV dynamics. Machine learning is the best solution to utilize the big data produced by vehicle sensors. To handle the uncertainty Bayesian machine learning statistical model is used. The proposed framework can adapt scenarios dynamically and infer using the maximum possible parameter available. The results indicated better performance than existing TM methods.

The concepts of smart cities smart societies smart countries and even smart earth have emerged and quickly develop to be an international agenda of significance. Smart societies have the following characteristics the ubiquity of information network the popularity and application of intelligent technique and highlight of data resource values. As the principal provider of public cultural services libraries should provide more convenient efficient and intelligent information and knowledge services. The transformation towards smart library is urgent which is mainly reflected in three aspects. First the resource processing organization and service methods of the library need to adapt to the new changes. Second libraries need to keenly sense and actively participate in building a new environment of knowledge services. Third libraries need to create more valuable physical space by using smart technologies. As the National Library Information Network Center the National Library of China NLC has promoted the transformation of Chinese librarianship from traditional libraries towards digital libraries by launching the National Digital Library Project the Digital Library Promoting Project and so on. Confronted with the new demands of smart libraries the NLC proposed to construct the National Smart Library System in order to further the transformation towards smart libraries from digital libraries by overall planning at the national level. Smart libraries have the following features intelligent management of the whole process of library business the multi-dimensional integration of knowledge resources covering the entire network the universal connectivity of knowledge service ecological chain and the online and offline virtual and real interaction of learning and reading space. The overall architecture of the National Smart Library Systemic an be concluded as 1+3+N. 1 refers to cloud smart library 3 refers to integrated storage of knowledge content across the network national smart library management system and operating environment of smart knowledge services and N refers to offline smart service space in libraries of all levels and grass-root service points. To guarantee the scientific development of the National Smart Library System the project will implement three supporting systems namely construction of the smart library evaluation system standards and regulation system and research and personnel training system. 1 fig. 20 refs. © 2021, Editorial Office of Journal of Library Science in China.

How to generate reliable LCZ maps has therefore become a research focus. In recent years, researchers have attempted to use Landsat imagery to delineate LCZs and generate maps worldwide based on the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT). However, the mapping results obtained by the WUDAPT method are not satisfactory. In this paper, to generate more accurate LCZ maps, we propose a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model (namely, LCZ-CNN), which is designed to cope with the issues of LCZ classification using Landsat imagery. Furthermore, in this study, we applied the LCZ-CNN model to generate LCZ mapping results for China’s 32 major cities distributed in various climatic zones, achieving a significantly better accuracy than the traditional classification strategies and a satisfactory computational efficiency. The proposed LCZ-CNN model achieved satisfactory classification accuracies in all 32 cities, and the Overall Accuracies (OAs) of more than half of the cities were higher than 80%. We also designed a series of experiments to comprehensively analyze the proposed LCZ-CNN model, with regard to the transferability of the network and the effectiveness of multi-seasonal information. It was found that the first convolutional stage, corresponding to low-level features, shows better transferability than the second and third convolutional stages, which extract high-level and more image- or task-oriented features. It was also confirmed that the multi-seasonal information can improve the accuracy of LCZ classification. The thermal characteristics of the different LCZ classes were also analyzed based on the mapping results for China’s 32 major cities, and the experimental results confirmed the close relationship between the LCZ classes and the magnitude of the Land Surface Temperature (LST). © 2021 Wuhan University.

A., Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Moscow Oblast, Russian Federation","A new class of post-industrial technologies is gradually being introduced into various sectors of the economy. However, the lack of application experience may hinder their spread. The article examines two issues of post-industrial technologies. Firstly, there is a need to identify promising (advanced) production technologies that are fundamentally different from traditional industrial technologies. Secondly, the study aims to assess the current stage of the development and application of these technologies on the example of the North-West of Russia. This assessment may be of interest for understanding the advantages of the technologies' use and the possibility of their distribution. The article describes the application of post-industrial technologies, giving examples of their use for attracting business and expanding the functions and responsibilities of regional authorities. Based on the structural method, post-industrial technologies were divided into various types: renewable energy sources, nanotechnologies, and information and communication technologies (ICTs). The article shows their distribution across the regions of the NorthWest of Russia, companies that implement post-industrial technologies and their products. The paper reveals the characteristics and definition of post-industrial technologies, as well as the specificity of their application in regions. In the North-West of Russia, regions with large resources in wind and water as well as partly solar energy sectors use renewable energy sources applying hybrid power systems (wind/solar, wind/solar/diesel) to supply power to remote small villages without centralised electricity systems. Nanotechnology are applied in the production of composite materials, metal-ceramic materials, nanoelectronics, laser cladding. Biotechnologies are used for processing animal waste and resources of the White Sea for the production of compound fertilisers, fast-degradable polymers, and biocomposites. Digital technologies are applied for the development of smart cities, smart power system, digital shipyard, robotics with artificial intelligence elements. The paper identifies the field of business application of postindustrial technologies, highlighting the increasing localisation and individualisation of production due to such technologies. The research results can be used for the elaboration of socio-economic development strategies, recommendations for business structures in the implementation of post-industrial technologies. Further studies should focus on the economic analysis of postindustrial technologies application, their convergence in production processes. © 2021 Institute of Economics, Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

A stabilized connection in the network is required to aid uninterrupted service support regardless of the frequent displacement in the vehicle position. The implication of drones or flying ad-hoc networks in VANETs is common in smart cities to provide transitory solutions for connectivity and data transfer. Considering the current and future applications of drones in diverse smart city applications, this article introduces the Decisive Data Dissemination Model (D3M). This proposed model is used for providing latency-less data transfer in drone-assisted VANET communications. The uncertainties in neighbor discovery due to handoff failure and access unavailability are addressed using non-recurrent classification learning. By using this learning, the splitting instance for handoff and neighbor requiring vehicles are identified to restore the fading connectivity. The re-connecting instances in the active and dissemination time are instantaneous using available drones and neighbors, preventing handoff failure. The performance of the proposed model is verified using simulations and it is seen that it achieves high data transfer rate, with less dissemination delay and backlogs. The proposed model for drones leverages data rate by 14.51% and reduces latency, backlogs, and failure by 16.99%, 10.49%, and 9.96%, respectively. The proposed D3M for vehicles achieves 14.85% high data rate, 20.57% less latency, 11.72% fewer backlogs, and 10.29% less failure, respectively. © 2013 IEEE.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85104264520,Yes,United States,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,Deep Learning,Classification,Develop non-recurrent classification learning model for drone assisted VANET in smart cities,"SDG 9, SDG 11",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Medium

IIoT has several applications in smart homes,smart cities, smart grids, connected cars, and supply chain management. However, these systems are being more frequently targeted by cybercriminals. Deep learning and big data analytics have great potential in designing and developing robust security mechanisms for IIoT networks. In this paper, anovel hybrid deep random neural network (HDRaNN) for cyberattack detection in the IIoT is presented. The HDRaNN combines a deep random neural network and a multilayer perceptron with dropout regularization. The proposed technique is evaluated using two IIoT security-related datasets: (i) DS2OS and (ii) UNSW-NB15. The performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed through a number of performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, log loss, Region of Convergence (ROC), andArea Under the Curve (AUC). The HDRaNN classified 16 different types of cyberattacks using with higher accuracy of 98% and 99% for DS2OS and UNSW-NB15, respectively. To measure the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, the performance metrics are also compared with several state-of-the-art attackdetection algorithms.

This information allows policy makers, urban planners, environmental and civil organizations to make investments, design infrastructure, extend public utility networks, plan housing solutions, and mitigate adverse environmental impacts. Despite its importance, urban growth models often discard the spatiotemporal uncertainties in their prediction estimates. In this paper, we analyzed the uncertainty in the urban land predictions by comparing the outcomes of two different growth models, one based on a widely applied cellular automata model known as the SLEUTH CA and the other one based on a previously published machine learning framework. We selected these two models because they are complementary, the first is based on human knowledge and pre-defined and understandable policies while the second is more data-driven and might be less influenced by any a priori knowledge or bias. To test our methodology, we chose the cities of Jiaxing and Lishui in China because they are representative of new town planning policies and have different characteristics in terms of land extension, geographical conditions, growth rates, and economic drivers. We focused on the spatiotemporal uncertainty, understood as the inherent doubt in the predictions of where and when will a piece of land become urban, using the concepts of certainty area in space and certainty area in time. The proposed analyses in this paper aim to contribute to better urban planning exercises, and they can be extended to other cities worldwide. © 2021 by the authors.

Slums are becoming an inevitable and growing phenomenon in cities of the global south, whose locations are inappropriate in official statistics and maps. Thus the automatic detection and identification of slums provides vibrant information to decision-makers for formulating pro-poor policies in urban planning. However, field surveys are used as the conventional methods for slum detection, which are expensive and inefficient. The challenge is to find an automatic approach for identifying slums from VHR imagery. Although numerous studies focused on detecting slums from satellite data, only limited number captured their differences. Due to the unique spectral signatures of urban slums, it could not be simply classified as other urban (buildings, vegetation, and roads) features. We explore the potential of the dilated kernel-based deep convolutional neural network (DK-DCNN) approach to the learning of discriminatory spatial features and the automatic detection of slums from other features. However, the result obtained by the proposed DK-DCNN achieves high accuracy. The open area of informal settlements and the roofing structures of formal settlements are misclassified as slums. Morphological spatial pattern analysis, based on mathematical morphology, is used as a postprocessing method to enhance the classification accuracy. The four distinct very high-resolution satellite images captured by WorldView-2 Sensor (1.84 m) of Madurai and Tiruppur city, South India, have shown the performance of the proposed method to distinguish urban slums from other features by producing higher accuracy than any other approach. © 2021 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103620817,Yes,India,Housing/Real Estate,Urban Planning & Land Use,Urban Development & Land Use,"CNN, Mathematical Morphology",Detection,Integrate deep CNNs and mathematical morphology for urban slum mapping,"SDG 1, SDG 11",Empirical,Mixed,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

Even though the intelligent city concept provides a lot of valuable services, security management is still one of the major issues due to shared threats and activities. For overcoming the above problems, smart cities' security factors should be analyzed continuously to eliminate the unwanted activities that used to enhance the quality of the services.

In this work, a deep reinforcement learning concept is used to learn the features of smart cities; the learning concept understands the entire activities of the smart city. During this energetic city, information is gathered with the help of security robots called cobalt robots. The smart cities related to new incoming features are examined through the use of a modular neural network. RESULTS: The system successfully predicts the unwanted activity in intelligent cities by dividing the collected data into a smaller subset, which reduces the complexity and improves the overall security management process.

However, a substantial increase in the urban population from the last few years poses challenges related to resource management, safety, and security. To ensure the safety and security in the smart city environment, this paper presents a novel approach by empowering the authorities to better visualize the threats, by identifying and predicting the highly-reported crime zones in the smart city. To this end, it first investigates the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) to detect the hot-spots that have a higher risk of crime occurrence. Second, for crime prediction, Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) is exploited in each dense crime region to predict the number of crime incidents in the future with spatial and temporal information. The proposed HDBSCAN and SARIMA based crime prediction model is evaluated on ten years of crime data (2008-2017) for New York City (NYC). The accuracy of the model is measured by considering different time scenarios such as the year-wise, (i.e., for each year), and for the total considered duration of ten years using an 80:20 ratio. The 80% of data was used for training and 20% for testing.

Even though congestion is not unusual, traffic jams still result in very high economic and social losses. Several factors cause congestion, one of which is traffic lights. Therefore, a mechanism is needed so that traffic lights can intelligently and adaptively manage signal time allocation according to traffic flow conditions. A traffic light with this type of mechanism is known as a smart traffic light. Smart traffic light cycle settings can be grouped based on the traffic density, scenarios for emergency vehicles, and the interests of pedestrians.

Previous studies focused on security threat detection and blocking technologies that rely on testbed data obtained from a single medical IoT device or simulation using a well-known dataset, such as the NSL-KDD dataset. However, such approaches do not re_ect the features that exist in real medical scenarios, leading to failure in potential threat detection.

In complex smart grid-connected systems, power scheduling and secure dispatch of information are the main research challenge.

The existing conventional security approaches have demonstrated limited success against some of the more complex cyber-attacks. This is primarily due to the sophistication of the attacks and the availability of powerful tools. Interconnected devices such as the Internet of Things (IoT) are also increasing attack exposures due to the increase in vulnerabilities. Over the last few years, we have seen a trend moving towards embracing edge technologies to harness the power of IoT devices and 5G networks. Edge technology brings processing power closer to the network and brings many advantages, including reduced latency, while it can also introduce vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Smart cities are also dependent on technologies where everything is interconnected. This interconnectivity makes them highly vulnerable to cyber-attacks, especially by the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT), as these vulnerabilities are amplified by the need to integrate new technologies with legacy systems. Cybercriminals behind APT attacks have recently been targeting the IoT ecosystems, prevalent in many of these cities. In this paper, we used a publicly available dataset on Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) and developed a data-driven approach for detecting APT stages using the Cyber Kill Chain. APTs are highly sophisticated and targeted forms of attacks that can evade intrusion detection systems, resulting in one of the greatest current challenges facing security professionals. In this experiment, we used multiple machine learning classifiers, such as Naïve Bayes, Bayes Net, KNN, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We used Weka performance metrics to show the numeric results. The best performance result of 91.1% was obtained with the Naïve Bayes classifier. We hope our proposed solution will help security professionals to deal with APTs in a timely and effective manner. © 2021 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.",Funding Statement: The work of Y.

There is a huge kind of these MCU called small general purpose devices, ESP8266 or RaspberryPi3 or any kind of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, which are connected to internet by means of a central node for sharing their information.

The successful completion of poverty-relief work can greatly improve the quality of people's life and ensure the sustainable development of the society. Poverty is a severe challenge for human society. It is of great significance to apply machine learning to mine different categories of poverty-stricken households and further provide decision support for poverty alleviation. Traditional poverty alleviation methods need to consume a lot of manpower, material resources, and financial resources. Based on the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), this paper designs the hierarchical DBSCAN clustering algorithm to identify and analyze the categories of poverty-stricken households in China. First, the proposed method adjusts the neighborhood radius dynamically for dividing the data space into several initial clusters with different densities. Then, neighbor clusters are identified by the border and inner distances constantly and aggregated recursively to form new clusters. Based on the idea of division and aggregation, the proposed method can recognize clusters of different forms and deal with noises effectively in the data space with imbalanced density distribution.

The objective of this study is to develop neural computing models used for automatic impervious surface area detection at a regional scale. To achieve this task, advanced optimizers of adaptive moment estimation (Adam), a variation of Adam called Adamax, Nesterov-accelerated adaptive moment estimation (Nadam), Adam with decoupled weight decay (AdamW), and a new exponential moving average variant (AMSGrad) are used to train the artificial neural network models employed for impervious surface detection. These advanced optimizers are benchmarked with the conventional gradient descent with momentum (GDM). Remotely sensed images collected from Sentinel-2 satellite for the study area of Da Nang city (Vietnam) are used to construct and verify the proposed approach. Moreover, texture descriptors including statistical measurements of color channels and binary gradient contour are employed to extract useful features for the neural computing model-based pattern recognition. Experimental result supported by statistical test points out that the Nadam optimizer-based neural computing model has achieved the most desired predictive accuracy for the data collected in the studied region with classification accuracy rate of 97.331%, precision = 0.961, recall = 0.984, negative predictive value = 0.985, and F1 score = 0.972.

From traffic management systems to urban cities planning and development, IoT based home monitoring systems, and many other smart applications. Regardless of these facilities, most of these IoT based solutions are data driven and results in small accuracy values for smaller datasets. In order to address this problem, this paper presents deep learning based hybrid approach for the development of an IoT-based intelligent home security and appliance control system in the smart cities. This hybrid model consists of; convolution neural network and binary long short term model for the object detection to ensure safety of the homes while IoT based hardware components like; Raspberry Pi, Amazon Web services cloud, and GSM modems for remotely accessing and controlling of the home appliances. An android application is developed and deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud for the remote monitoring of home appliances. A GSM device and Message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) are integrated for communicating with the connected IoT devices to ensure the online and offline communication. For object detection purposes a camera is connected to Raspberry Pi using the proposed hybrid neural network model. The applicability of the proposed model is tested by calculating results for the object at varying distance from the camera and for different intensity levels of the light. Besides many applications the proposed model promises for providing optimum results for the small amount of data and results in high recognition rates of 95.34% compared to the conventional recognition model (k nearest neighbours) recognition rate of 76%. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

IoT is a large-scale ecosystem of socio-technical application. The emerging technology of IoT has gained enormous attention in a wide range of industries and used in various kind of environments. Healthcare application is one of the vital IoT applications for smart cities. Medical devices and applications of IoT healthcare are emerging rapidly in the global market. Various IoT-based health applications have been proposed to help patients monitor the disease and track the health information without visiting the hospital, clinic, or any medical centre. This paper has briefly described the methods and devices used in IoT-based healthcare application, namely blood pressure monitoring, glucose and cholesterol monitoring, asthma monitoring, and stroke rehabilitation system. The modelling and simulation process of IoT-based healthcare applications are discussed on blood pressure and stroke rehabilitation system only. The development of electrocardiogram (ECG) and Photoplethysmogram (PPG) in blood pressure measurement integration with a smartphone has created simplicity and usability of the device. Nevertheless, further investigation is required to improve the accuracy in collecting the patient’s health information. For hand rehabilitation training purposes, an IoT-enabled stroke rehabilitation device depends on machine learning, smart wearable armband and a 3D printed robot hand were developed to imitate the movements of the patient in a real-time mode. The feature selection used in the development of the device using machine learning has produced a high classification accuracy which helps stroke patients to strengthen the muscles with their motion patterns after stroke. © 2021 Nurul Amirah Mashudi et al.",This work is supported by Universiti Teknologi Malaysia under research University Grant Q.K130000.3556.06G45 for the financial support provided throughout this research project.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85101924946,No,Malaysia,Healthcare/Wellbeing,Health & Well-being,Social Equity & Quality of Life,IoT,Simulation,Review modelling and simulation of IoT systems in healthcare applications,"SDG 3, SDG 11",Review/Survey,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Urban agriculture is an approach to producing food inside cities where, globally, more than half the worlds population live. It has been shown to have a range of potential benefits, for instance in reducing waste and logistics costs. Increased uptake of urban farming can even relieve pressure on the natural environment by reducing the burden of production required from farmland by creating space for it to recover from accumulated damage as a result of the use of unsustainable farming practices historically. This article describes an approach for a new type of decision support system suitable for urban farming production. We discuss differences between the requirements and the users of decision support in urban agriculture, and those of ordinary agribusiness enterprises. A case study is performed using a novel technology for urban farming: a cyber-physical implementation of aquaponics is enhanced with adaptive capabilities using a digital twin system and machine learning. Aquaponics is a farming technique that utilizes a harmonious nutrient exchange cycle for growing plants and fish together, while conserving water, and possibly without the need for soil or even sunlight. Empirical results are provided that evaluate the use of data driven decision analytics and a digital twin model to plan production from the aquaponic system during a three month trial. Another set of results evaluate a proposed modelling framework for large scale urban agriculture ecosystems. This concept forms the basis of the suggested approach for an urban farming decision support system that coordinates the activities of many independent producers to target collective goals. © 2013 IEEE.",This work was supported by the Science and Technology Innovation Committee Foundation of Shenzhen under Grant JCYJ20180302174253713.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85101753832,Yes,China,Agriculture,Environment & Sustainability,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,"Digital Twin, Deep Learning",Decision Support,Develop a decision support system for urban agriculture using digital twin with aquaponics case study,"SDG 2, SDG 11",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Past,Cross-sectional,Strong

The nighttime light (NTL) datasets have been widely utilized to estimate the socio-economic parameters. However, the precision of the published datasets was too coarse to meet related issues such as flood losses assessment, urban planning, and epidemiological studies. The present study calibrated gross domestic product (GDP), population (POP), electric consumption (EC), and urban build-up area (B-A) at 100 m resolution for 45 cities of China in 2018 using Luojia1-01 NTL datasets via random forest (RF) as well as geographically weighted regression (GWR) model. The linear regression (LR), back propagation neural network (BPNN), and support vector machine (SVM) methods were selected for comparison with GWR and RF models. Besides, the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership-Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) was chosen for comparison with Luojia1-01. The ten-folded cross-validation (CV) has been used for evaluating accuracy at county and city scales. Finally, the distribution maps of socio-economic parameters were illustrated and some findings were obtained. First, the validation results revealed that the calibration at the city-scale outperformed the county or district scale. Second, the precision of the Luojia1-01 NTL dataset surpassed the NPP-VIIRS NTL dataset on the same administrative scale except for some specific situations. Third, the precision of the simulation for the gross domestic product (GDP) is the highest than the others, followed by electric consumption (EC), build-up area (B-A), and population (POP). Fourth, the optimum model varied according to the socio-economic parameters. Fifth, the distribution of socio-economic parameters exhibited obvious spatial heterogeneity.

A vast number of studies which are designed to understand these accidents' leading causes and mechanisms exist. The widely held view is that emerging analysis methods can be a critical tool for understanding the complex interactions between land use and urban transportation. Using a case study of Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP) in Suzhou, China, this paper examines the relationship between different land use types and traffic accidents using a gradient boosting model (GBM) machine learning method. The results show that the GBM can be used as an effective accident model for a variety of research and analysis methods by (1) ranking the influential factors, (2) testing the degree of interpretation of each variable as the complexity of iterations changes, and (3) obtaining partial dependence plots, among other methods. The findings of this study also suggest that land use types - including facility points - demonstrate differing degrees of influence at two geographical scales: local level and neighborhood level. In the ranking of relative importance at both scales, the variables of education institutions, traffic lights, and service institutions are all ranked high - with a more significantinfluence on the occurrence of accidents. However, residential land and land use mix variables differed significantly in both scales and showed a significant deviation compared to the other results.When adjusting the complexity of the decision tree, the local level is more suitable for measuring variables such as residential areas and green parks where pedestrians and vehicles have fixed mobility periods and moderate flows. On the contrary, the nearest neighborhood level is more suitable toa small number of variables related to public service facilities at fixed locations, such as traffic lights and bus stops. In the partial dependence plots, all variables, except educational institutions and residences, show a positive correlation for accidents in the fitting process. The results of this study can ideally help inform transportation planners to reconsider transport accident occurrence rates in the context of the proximity to various land use types and public service facilities. © 2021 Yueming Yang et al.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100655346,Yes,China,Safety/Crime,Security & Safety,Urban Resilience & Safety,Gradient Boosting Machine,Analysis,Examine relationship between traffic accidents and land use using gradient boosting machine,"SDG 3, SDG 11",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

Such wide deployment of HAR systems often faces the annotation-scarcity challenge; that is, most of the HAR techniques, especially the deep learning techniques, require a large number of training data while annotating sensor data is very time- and effort-consuming. Unsupervised domain adaptation has been successfully applied to tackle this challenge, where the activity knowledge from a well-annotated domain can be transferred to a new, unlabelled domain. However, these existing techniques do not perform well on highly heterogeneous domains. This article proposes shift-GAN that integrate bidirectional generative adversarial networks (Bi-GAN) and kernel mean matching (KMM) in an innovative way to learn intrinsic, robust feature transfer between two heterogeneous domains. Bi-GAN consists of two GANs that are bound by a cyclic constraint, which enables more effective feature transfer than a classic, single GAN model. KMM is a powerful non-parametric technique to correct covariate shift, which further improves feature space alignment. Through a series of comprehensive, empirical evaluations, shift-GAN has not only achieved its superior performance over 10 state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques but also demonstrated its effectiveness in learning activity-independent, intrinsic feature mappings between two domains, robustness to sensor noise, and less sensitivity to training data. © 2013 IEEE.","The work was supported by the Italian MIUR, PRIN 2017 Project ‘‘Fluidware,’’ under Grant N. 2017KRC7KT.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100471007,Yes,United Kingdom,Healthcare/Wellbeing,Health & Well-being,Social Equity & Quality of Life,"GAN, Domain Adaptation",Classification,Develop unsupervised domain adaptation in activity recognition using GAN-based approach,"SDG 3, SDG 11",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

These technologies have also been successful in characterizing urban environments in terms of their structural units, structure types, or morphological regions. In these approaches, an urban area is partitioned into regions that exhibit homogeneous physical characteristics. However, existing approaches are typically limited to a single city, use inconsistent typologies, and lack scalability and generalization capacity. In this article, we propose an urban structural units categorization scheme and demonstrate its utility by applying it to 13 cities. Inspired by the lack of scalability and generalization capacity in urban structural units mapping, we extend the reach of deep learning and conduct a set of classification experiments in all 13 cities. These experiments offer insights into the strengths and limitations of deep neural networks for classifying urban structural units over diverse geographic regions and on heterogeneous collections of satellite imagery. The efficacy of the proposed deep learning approach is compared to a baseline method of multiscale image features and support vector machines. Our validation on five cities shows that better performance is achieved with deep neural networks. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of input size, model depth, and spatial pyramid pooling to assess the generalization capacity of deep neural networks. © 2008-2012 IEEE.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100462562,Yes,United States,Urban Planning,Urban Planning & Land Use,Urban Development & Land Use,Deep Learning,Classification,Develop large-scale classification of urban structural units from remote sensing imagery,SDG 11,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

In this study, we focus on the land use dynamics of the urban agglomeration around Hangzhou Bay, where the Qiantang River flows into the East China Sea. The Hangzhou Bay Bridge crosses the bay since 2008. We used Interrupted Time Series Analysis (ITSA) to analyze the influence of the bridge on the land use and land cover (LULC) time series of the surrounding areas and on socio-economic indicators. We applied the Random Forest method to classify Landsat imagery from 2000 to 2017, thus enabling us to quantify LULC changes before and after the construction of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge. Google Earth Engine (GEE) was used for data acquisition, pre-processing, and classification. The results showed that during the period from 2000 to 2017, impervious surface areas expanded rapidly at the expense of agricultural land, and this transformation continued even more rapidly after 2008. ITSA showed that the driver behind the impervious surface area expansion switched from residential and industrial area growth in 2000–2008, to exclusively infrastructure area growth in 2008–2017. The construction of the bridge accelerated the expansion of impervious surface in the joint area of the bridge-connected cities of Ningbo and Jiaxing. With the Hangzhou Bay Bridge connection, various socio-economic factors, including tourism, GDP, tertiary industry, real estate investment, and highway freight, increased rapidly. The outcomes of this research could contribute to policymaking and impact assessments for sustainable urban development and land management. The methods used in this study are universal and therefore can also be used to assess the effect of any notable event that may impact LULC change. © 2021 The Author(s).

From connected devices to live vehicle tracking, technology is taking the field of transportation to a new level. An essential part of the transportation domain in mart cities is to share vehicles. Sharing vehicles is an impeccable solution to issues like vehicle congestion, pollution, and the rapid consumption of fuel. Even though carpooling has several benefits, currently, the usage is significantly low due to social barriers, long rider waiting time, and unfair pricing models. Considering these issues, we have designed an enhanced vehicle-sharing model with two matching layers. The first layer matches riders based on similar characteristics, and the second layer provides matching options to riders and drivers to restrict the waiting time by using personalized threshold time. At the end of trips, feedback is collected from users according to five characteristics. Then, the two main characteristics that are the most important to riders are determined based on the collected feedback. The characteristics and classifiers are fed to our machine-learning classification module. For new users, the module predicts riders’ characteristics, which allows riders to be matched to riders with similar characteristics. We have carried out an extensive simulation and measured the efficiency of the matching model while comparing the results with and without machine learning algorithms. In the simulation, we have used real-time New York City Cab traffic data with real-traffic conditions by using Google Maps APIs. Results indicate that the proposed model is feasible and efficient as the number of riders increases while maintaining threshold time for riders. Our proposed model and obtained results will help service providers to increase the usage of carpooling, and implicitly preserve natural resources and improve environmental conditions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099981358,Yes,Unknown,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,"Machine Learning, Recommender System",Recommendation,Develop an enhanced ride sharing model based on human characteristics and machine learning,SDG 11,Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

S., Ontology Engineering Group, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Madrid, Madrid, Spain","Most studies about the solar forecasting topic do not analyze and exploit the temporal and spatial components that are inherent to such a task. Furthermore, they mostly focus just on precision and not on other meaningful features, such as flexibility and robustness. With the current energy production trends, where many solar panels are distributed across city rooftops, there is a need to manage all this information simultaneously and to be able to add and remove sensors as needed. Likewise, robust models need to be able to cope with (inevitable) sensor failure and continue producing reliable predictions. Due to all of this, solar forecasting models need to be as decoupled as possible from the number of data sources that feed them and their geographical distribution, enabling also the reusability of the models. This article contributes with a family of Deep Learning models for solar irradiance forecasting complying with the aforementioned features, i.e. flexibility and robustness. In the first stage, several Artificial Neural Networks are trained as a basis for predicting solar irradiance on several locations at the same time. Thereupon, a family of models that work with irradiance maps thanks to Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory layers is presented, obtaining forecast skills between 7.4% and 41% (depending on the location and horizon) compared to the baseline. The latter family comes with flexibility and robustness features, which are required in large-scale Intelligent Environments, such as Smart Cities. Working with irradiance maps means that new sensors can be added (or removed) as needed, without requiring rebuilding the model. Experiments carried out show that sensor failures have a mild impact on the prediction error for several forecast horizons. © 2013 IEEE.","This work was supported in part by the Autonomous Region of Madrid through the program CABAHLA-CM under Grant P2018/TCS-4423, in part by the Euratom Research and Training Programme 2019-2020 ENTENTE under Grant 900018, and in part by the R&D project Datos 4.0: Retos y soluciones under Grant TIN2016-78011-C4-4-R and Grant AEI/FEDER, UE.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099725509,Yes,Spain,Energy/Utilities,Smart City Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Deep Learning,Prediction/Forecasting,Develop a flexible and robust deep learning system for solar irradiance forecasting,"SDG 7, SDG 11",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Longitudinal,Strong

The short term power load forecasting of individual as well as group of similar energy customers is critical for effective operation and management of SG. Forecasting power load of individual as well as group of similar energy customers is challenging compared to aggregate load forecasting of a residential community. The main reason is the high volatility and uncertainty involved for the case of individual and group of similar energy customers. Several machine/deep learning models have been developed in the recent past for forecasting load of individual energy customers, but such explorations are ineffective due to the requirement of one trained model for every energy customer, which is practically not feasible. We plan to build a deep learning model using convolutional neural network (CNN) layers in pyramidal architecture for effective load forecasting for a group of similar energy-profile customers. Initially, we grouped a subset of energy customers from database of Smart Grid Smart City (SGSC) into clusters using DBSCAN approach. The CNN layers are used for extracting feature from historical load of each cluster. The extracted feature of similar energy-profile customers (grouped based on clustering) is combined to make training-databases for each cluster. We have used the power load data from SGSC project, which contain thousands of individual household energy customers data. The developed Pyramid-CNN model is trained based on these sets of databases. The trained model is evaluated on randomly selected customers from few clusters. We obtained significantly improved forecasting results for randomly selected user from different clusters. Our adapted strategy of clustering based model training resulted in upto 10 percent MAPE improvement for the energy customers. The essence of our work is that energy customers can be grouped into clusters and then representative model could be developed/trained, which can accurately forecast power load for individual energy-customer. This approach is highly feasible, as we do not need to train a model per energy customer and still achieve competitive forecasting results. © 2013 IEEE.","This work was supported by the Deputyship for Research and Innovation, ‘‘Ministry of Education‘‘ in Saudi Arabia, through the project IFKSURG-1438-034.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099723219,Yes,Saudi Arabia,Energy/Utilities,Smart City Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,Pyramid-CNN,Prediction/Forecasting,Develop a Pyramid-CNN based deep learning model for power load forecasting,"SDG 7, SDG 11",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

The present study aims to estimate future LULC and seasonal (summer and winter) LST scenarios in one of the fastest-growing megacities and the business capital of Bangladesh, named as Chattogram. Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and Landsat thermal bands were used to retrieve LULC and LST changing patterns for 1999, 2009 and 2019, respectively. The Cellular Automata (CA) and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) machine learning algorithms were applied to simulate the LULC and seasonal LST scenarios for 2029 and 2039. The CA and ANN model were validated using simulated and estimated LULC and LST data for 2019. The CA model demonstrated an excellent accuracy with an overall kappa value of 0.82. Mean Square Error (MSE) and Correlation coefficient (R) values were used for ANN model validation, which also produced excellent results with 0.523 and 0.796 in summer and 0.6023 and 0.831 in winter season, respectively. Simulated LULC revealed a substantial increase in the urban built-up areas by 9.23% (2029) and 13.59% (2039), compared with the year 2019. Simulated summer LST demonstrates that 31.30% and 35.02% area will likely to face surface temperature more than 36°C, followed by 1.28% and 29.53% area in winter season for year 2029 and 2039, respectively. The seasonal LST scenarios in different LULC demonstrated comparatively higher temperatures in built-up areas. Based on the results, a strong correlation was found between the changes in urban areas and raising LST by representing major encounters for environmental engineers and urban planners to mitigate the consequences of the surface urban heat island (SUHI) phenomenon. For ensuring sustainable urban growth and minimizing the SUHI effect in this fastest-growing megacity, future city master plan must focus on the importance of urban plantation and conservation of natural resources. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Authors are thankful to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) for Landsat archives.

The road forward about the operational environment is certain about the swarms of fully automated UAVs (FAUAVs), that is, urban areas. FAUAVs with self-learning and self-decision-making abilities by executing non-trivial sequences of events with decimetre-level accuracy based on a set of rules, control loops and constraints using dynamic flight plans and trajectories are taking their indispensable parts within smart cities (SCs). Therefore, their integration with the SC components using real-time data analytics is urgent. This is mainly required to establish a better swarm intelligence along with a safer and optimised harmonious smart ecosystem that enables cooperative FAUAV-SC automation systems with collaborative automated intelligence engaging in the concepts of Internet of Everything (IoE) and Automation of Everything (AoE). Planning the future of cities with swarms of FAUAVs is explored in this paper to optimise the use of FAUAVs with a diverse range of applications and a contemporary methodology is proposed using a holistic framework - FAUAVinSCF equipped with various effective and efficient techniques along with a novel FAUAV routing technique customisable to the constraints of FAUAVs and urban areas. With the methodology, the components of SC and FAUAVs involving recent and impending technological advancements are moulded together to make this inevitable transformation a harmonious part of the inhabitants contributing to the cities' liveability and sustainability. The framework consists of a decentralized agent-based control architecture that monitors and controls the swarms of resource-constraint FAUAVs for their real-time requirements in optimising their urban uses. The outcomes of the methodology suggest that the constraints of FAUAVs can be mitigated significantly in urban areas and consequently, their efficacy can be increased in realising their diverse range of missions. © 2013 IEEE.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099233438,Yes,United Kingdom,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,"AI, Autonomous UAVs",Planning,Develop a novel framework for planning smart cities with swarms of fully autonomous UAVs,"SDG 9, SDG 11",Conceptual/Theoretical,Qualitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities of such an unprecedently connected world. As of 19 November 2020, over 56 million people have been infected with nearly 1.35 million deaths, and the numbers are growing. The state-of-the-art social media analytics for COVID-19-related studies to understand the various phenomena happening in our environment are limited and require many more studies. This paper proposes a software tool comprising a collection of unsupervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) machine learning and other methods for the analysis of Twitter data in Arabic with the aim to detect government pandemic measures and public concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. The tool is described in detail, including its architecture, five software components, and algorithms. Using the tool, we collect a dataset comprising 14 million tweets from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) for the period 1 February 2020 to 1 June 2020. We detect 15 government pandemic measures and public concerns and six macro-concerns (economic sustainability, social sustainability, etc.), and formulate their information-structural, temporal, and spatio-temporal relationships. For example, we are able to detect the timewise progression of events from the public discussions on COVID-19 cases in mid-March to the first curfew on 22 March, financial loan incentives on 22 March, the increased quarantine discussions during March-April, the discussions on the reduced mobility levels from 24 March onwards, the blood donation shortfall late March onwards, the government’s 9 billion SAR (Saudi Riyal) salary incentives on 3 April, lifting the ban on five daily prayers in mosques on 26 May, and finally the return to normal government measures on 29 May 2020. These findings show the effectiveness of the Twitter media in detecting important events, government measures, public concerns, and other information in both time and space with no earlier knowledge about them. © 2021 by the authors.

In a PSS, individuals with mobile devices sense their environment, collect, and share data. For smart cities, intelligent city dynamics analysis has many applications such as for urban planning, transportation systems, city environment, energy consumption, public safety, and city economy. This study aimed to develop an intelligent application to predict the potential number of visitors for specific venues based on the analysis of mobility patterns of individuals. The ability to accurately predict the number of visitors to a venue allows authorities to better understand the behavior of the people and allocate recourses accordingly. We formulated the venue-popularity problem as a sequence-based regression and classification problem. We employed three recurrent neural network (RNN)-based models to predict the locations of popular venues on a city map. The proposed models include basic RNN, long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU). We constructed several social datasets for Riyadh city using Twitter and Foursquare as the PSS. Our results revealed that modeling venue-popularity prediction as a sequence regression problem yields better results than modeling it as a sequence classification problem.

The quest for suitable predictive models to improve realistic simulation of urban land use change has resulted in the use of several notable cellular automata calibrations. Cellular automata model has become very attractive and one of the strongest models for urban growth simulation due to its simplicity and possibility of evolution. However, the inability of cellular automata to include driving forces of urban growth in the simulation process has warranted further cellular automata calibrations to minimize this weakness. To address this problem, and contrary to previous cellular automata calibrations, this research presents a novel integration of support vector machine, Markov chain and cellular automata for urban change modelling. Support vector machine is introduced as a machine learning technique to mine the impact of the explanatory variables that drive urban change. Markov chain is employed to mine the urban transition probabilities between the various urban epochs while cellular automata are used to implement the incremental discrete time steps based on neighbourhood interaction from an initial time to a future time. This modelling is implemented using Landsat data acquired in 1984, 2000 and 2015 over Lagos in Nigeria, Africa's most populous city. Urban transitions (1984–2000 and 2000–2015) are used to simulate future urban state in 2030 and validation metrics include McNemar's test. The introduction of stochasticity into the model helps create the typical randomness inherent in the real world for deriving future urban forms through discrete cellular automata iterations. The high accuracy obtained in this experiment implies a substantial fit between the predicted and reference data. This outcome proves the robustness of this method for modelling urban change. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",The authors are grateful to USGS for the Landsat data used in this study.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85098984348,Yes,Nigeria,Land Use/Zoning,Urban Planning & Land Use,Urban Development & Land Use,"Machine Learning, CA, Markov Chain",Prediction/Forecasting,Integrate machine learning with Markov chain and cellular automata for urban land use change modelling,"SDG 11, SDG 15",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Longitudinal,Strong

It is efficient because it facilitates the implementation of data acquisition and data management methods, as well as data representation and dashboard configuration. The platform allows for the use of any type of data source, ranging from the measurements of a multifunctional IoT sensing devices to relational and non-relational databases. It is also smart because it incorporates a complete artificial intelligence suit for data analysis; it includes techniques for data classification, clustering, forecasting, optimization, visualization, etc. It is also compatible with the edge computing concept, allowing for the distribution of intelligence and the use of intelligent sensors. The concept of smart cities is evolving and adapting to new applications; the trend to create intelligent neighbourhoods, districts or territories is becoming increasingly popular, as opposed to the previous approach of managing an entire megacity. In this paper, the platform is presented, and its architecture and functionalities are described. Moreover, its operation has been validated in a case study where the bike renting service of Paris-Vélib’ Métropole has been managed. This platform could enable smart territories to develop adapted knowledge management systems, adapt them to new requirements and to use multiple types of data, and execute efficient computational and artificial intelligence algorithms. The platform optimizes the decisions taken by human experts through explainable artificial intelligence models that obtain data from IoT sensors, databases, the Internet, etc. The global intelligence of the platform could potentially coordinate its decision-making processes with intelligent nodes installed in the edge, which would use the most advanced data processing techniques. © 2021 by the authors.

Under the backdrop of global urbanization, some cities are particularly vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters that are influenced by unplanned urban expansion. Rational planning of urban functional areas needs to be strengthened to improve the scientific approach of urban planning and urbanization. In this study, the classification of urban functional areas based on dual-modal data (i.e., remote sensing image and user behavior data) was implemented using machine learning (ML) algorithms. After the set test, the classification accuracy of urban functional areas reached 82.45%. Through analysis, it could be concluded that the use of data of two modalities achieved a higher classification accuracy than that achieved by using data of a single modality. The data of the two modalities complement each other, and the use of ML algorithms to train such data can yield good results. © 2020 IEEE.","Manuscript received September 14, 2020; revised November 6, 2020 and December 6, 2020; accepted December 9, 2020.

FAGVs by executing non-trivial sequences of events with decimetre-level accuracy live in Smart City (SC) and their integration with all the SC components and domains using real-time data analytics is urgent to establish better swarm intelligent systems and a safer and optimised harmonious smart environment enabling cooperative FAGVs-SC automation systems. The challenges of urbanisation, if unmet urgently, would entail severe economic and environmental impacts. The integration of FAGVs with SC helps improve the sustainability of a city and the functional and efficient deployment of hand over wheels on robotized city roads with behaviour coordination. SC can enable the exploitation of the full potential of FAGVs with embedded centralised systems within SC with highly distributed systems in a concept of Automation of Everything (AoE). This article proposes a synergistic integrated FAGV-SC holistic framework - FAGVinSCF in which all the components of SC and FAGVs involving recent and impending technological advancements are moulded to make the transformation from today's driving society to future's next-generation driverless society smoother and truly make self-driving technology a harmonious part of our cities with sustainable urban development. Based on FAGVinSCF, a simulation platform is built both to model the varying penetration levels of FAGV into mixed traffic and to perform the optimal self-driving behaviours of FAGV swarms. The results show that FAGVinSCF improves the urban traffic flow significantly without huge changes to the traffic infrastructure. With this framework, the concept of Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) is transformed into the concept of Automated ITS (A-ITS). Cities currently designed for cars can turn into cities developed for citizens using FAGVinSCF enabling more sustainable cities. © 2013 IEEE.",,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85098755661,Yes,United Kingdom,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,"AI, Autonomous Vehicles",Integration,Develop a framework for synergistic integration of fully autonomous ground vehicles with smart city,"SDG 9, SDG 11",Conceptual/Theoretical,Qualitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

In keypoint-based detectors, the prediction modules are usually generated from a fixed feature map scale. This configuration significantly limits the ability to detect multiscale objects in aerial scenes. The corner selection module in these detectors often ignores that a category in an aerial image is relatively unitary. In this article, a novel network, called the multiscale keypoint detection network (MKD-Net), is proposed to address these challenges. MKD-Net fuses multiscale layers to generate multiple feature maps for objects of different sizes. During the inference phase, both feature maps can be exploited for predicting corners. Moreover, a category attention module is designed to reduce the channel noise for a single-category scene. Experiments on benchmarks PASCAL VOC and DOTA show promising performance of MKD-Net compared with the baseline network.

Moreover, the proliferation in the development of smart cities across the globe necessitates the emergence of a robust smart waste management system for proper waste segregation based on its biodegradability. The present work investigates a novel approach for waste segregation for its effective recycling and disposal by utilizing a deep learning strategy. The YOLOv3 algorithm has been utilized in the Darknet neural network framework to train a self-made dataset. The network has been trained for 6 object classes (namely: cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic and organic waste). Moreover, for comparative assessment, the detection task has also been performed using YOLOv3-tiny to validate the competence of the YOLOv3 algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed YOLOv3 methodology yields satisfactory generalization capability for all the classes with a variety of waste items. © 2020 by the authors.

To improve the vehicle detection abilities in such online safety systems, in this paper, we propose a novel multi-sensor multi-level enhanced convolutional network model, called multi-sensor multi-level enhanced convolutional network architecture (MME-YOLO), with consideration of hybrid realistic scene of scales, illumination, and occlusion. MME-YOLO consists of two tightly coupled structures, i.e., the enhanced inference head and the LiDAR-Image composite module. More specifically, the enhanced inference head pre-liminarily equips the network with stronger inference abilities for redundant visual cues by atten-tion-guided feature selection blocks and anchor-based/anchor-free ensemble head. Furthermore, the LiDAR-Image composite module cascades the multi-level feature maps from the LiDAR subnet to the image subnet, which strengthens the generalization of the detector in complex scenarios. Compared with YOLOv3, the enhanced inference head achieves a 5.83% and 4.88% mAP improvement on visual dataset LVSH and UA-DETRAC, respectively. Integrated with the composite module, the overall architecture gains 91.63% mAP in the collected Road-side Dataset. Experiments show that even under the abnormal lightings and the inconsistent scales at evening rush hours, the proposed MME-YOLO maintains reliable recognition accuracy and robust detection performance. © 2020 by the authors.

In this article, we propose an automatic system for estimation of the annual average daily traffic (AADT) using very-high-resolution optical remote-sensing imagery of urban areas in combination with high-quality, but very spatially limited, ground-based measurements. The main part of the system is the vehicle detection, which is based on the deep learning object detection architecture mask region-based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN), modified with an image normalization strategy to make it more robust for test images of various conditions and the use of a precise road mask to assist the filtering of driving vehicles from parked ones. Furthermore, to include the high-quality ground-based measurements and to make the traffic estimates more consistent across neighbouring road links, we propose a graph smoothing strategy that utilizes the road network. The fully automatic processing chain has been validated on a set of aerial images covering the city of Narvik, Norway. The precision and recall rate of detecting driving vehicles was 0.74 and 0.66, respectively, and the AADT was estimated with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 2279 and bias of −383. We conclude that separating driving vehicles from parked ones may be challenging if vehicles are parked along the roads and that for urban environment with short road links several remote-sensing images covering the road links at different time instances are necessary in order to benefit from the remote-sensing images. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","This research was funded by the Research Council of Norway, [grant number 267734] (AirQuip project).

Drones have proven their potential in providing real-time cost-efficient solutions for several applications like healthcare, smart grid surveillance, smart city monitoring, and border surveillance. Though it has many security and privacy issues, researchers across the globe have given numerous solutions to protect drone communication from cyber-attacks. Most of these solutions were based on cryptographic techniques and are highly compute extensive. There exist few blockchain-based solutions, which suffer from high transaction storage costs with communication reliability, latency, and bandwidth issues. Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey to secure drone communication and propose a blockchain-based secure and intelligent drone communication architecture underlying 5G communication network and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The proposed architecture uses an InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) as a platform for data storage, which ensures improved network performance, communication security and privacy, and reduces transaction storage cost. Further, it facilitates efficient drone communication in providing dynamic, flexible, and on-the-fly decisions competencies through 5G and AI technologies.

The worldwide transport departments face many obstacles following the implementation and integration of different vehicle features. One of these tasks is to ensure that vehicles are autonomous, intelligent and able to grow their repository of information. Machine learning has recently been implemented in wireless networks, as a major artificial intelligence branch, to solve historically challenging problems through a data-driven approach. In this article, we discuss recent progress of applying machine learning into vehicle networks for intelligent route decision and try to focus on this emerging field. Deep Extreme Learning Machine (DELM) framework is introduced in this article to be incorporated in vehicles so they can take human-like assessments. The present GPS compatibility issues make it difficult for vehicles to take real-time decisions under certain conditions. It leads to the concept of vehicle controller making self-decisions. The proposed DELM based system for self-intelligent vehicle decision makes use of the cognitive memory to store route observations. This overcomes inadequacy of the current in-vehicle route-finding technology and its support. All the relevant route-related information for the ride will be provided to the user based on its availability. Using the DELM method, a high degree of precision in smart decision taking with a minimal error rate is obtained. During investigation, it has been observed that proposed framework has the highest accuracy rate with 70% of training (1435 samples) and 30% of validation (612 samples). Simulation results validate the intelligent prediction of the proposed method with 98.88%, 98.2% accuracy during training and validation respectively. © 2020 Tech Science Press.

The results show that in the analysis of image local optimization effect, it is found that the classification performance of all algorithms decreases with the increase of noise, and the performance of local anisotropic mode (LAP) is superior, which has strong robustness to rotation, illumination, and noise. In the analysis of image feature similarity effect, it is found that the chi square distance between Log Gabor features is positively correlated with the degree of image distortion, and the validity of the measurement method is verified. Further analysis of the video processing effect of industrial visual perception technology shows that the video processing effect of test algorithm is significantly better than that of HM16.8 by comparing the distortion performance of the two algorithms with different sequences, with low distortion and significantly improved performance.

More precisely, data-driven smart applications that efficiently manage sparse resources are offering a futuristic vision of smart, efficient, and secure city operations. However, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the limitations of existing smart city deployment; hence; the development of systems and architectures capable of providing fast and effective mechanisms to limit further spread of the virus has become paramount. An active surveillance system capable of monitoring and enforcing social distancing between people can effectively slow the spread of this deadly virus.

This study integrated random forest (RF), self-organizing map (SOM), and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques to assess water demand patterns and to develop a predictive model for the city of Fortaleza, Brazil. We performed the analysis at two spatial scales, with different level of information: census tracts (CTs) at the fine scale, and census blocks (CBs) at the coarse scale. At the CB scale, demand was modeled with socioeconomic, demographic, and household characteristics. The RF technique was applied to rank these variables, and the most relevant were used to cluster census blocks with SOMs. RFs and ANNs were used in an iterative approach to define the input variables for the predictive model with minimum redundancy. At the CT scale, demand was modeled using HDI and per capita income. Variables which assess the education level and economic aspects of households demonstrated a direct relationship with water demand. The analysis at the coarse scale provided more insight into the relationship between the variables; however, the predictive model performed better at the fine scale. This study demonstrates how data-driven models can be helpful for water management, especially in environments with strong socioeconomic inequalities, where urban planning decisions should be integrated and inclusive. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",The research was supported by grants from the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior—Brasil (CAPES) and the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico—Brasil (CNPq).,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85095825640,Yes,Brazil,Water/Sanitation,Smart City Infrastructure,Digital Transformation & Smart Cities,"Random Forest, SOM, ANN",Prediction/Forecasting,"Model urban water demand using machine learning techniques for Fortaleza, Brazil","SDG 6, SDG 11",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

Within a few weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak, lockdown accelerated the adoption of digital solutions at an unprecedented pace, creating unforeseen opportunities for scaling up alternative approaches to social and economic life. But it also brought digital risks and threats that placed new demands on policymakers. This article assembles evidence from different areas of social science expertise about the impacts of Covid-19 in digitised societies and policy responses. The authors show how the pandemic supported changes in data collection techniques and dissemination practices for official statistics, and how seemingly insuperable obstacles to the implementation of e-health treatments were largely overcome. They demonstrate how the ethics of artificial intelligence became a primary concern for government legislation at national and international levels, and how the features enabling smart cities to act as drivers of productivity did not necessarily give them an advantage during the pandemic. At the micro-level, families are shown to have become ‘digital by default’, as children were exposed to online risks and opportunities. Globally, the spread of the pandemic provided a fertile ground for cybercrime, while digital disinformation and influencing risked becoming normalised and domesticated. © 2020 Academy of Social Sciences.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85094927634,No,United Kingdom,Governance/Policy,Governance & Society,Social Equity & Quality of Life,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,Discuss COVID-19 impacts on digital revolution and evidence-based policy,"SDG 3, SDG 11",Review/Survey,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this paper, we present a machine-learning-enabled approach to predicting the prevalence of six common non-communicable chronic diseases at the census tract level. We apply our approach to the City of Austin and show that our method can yield fairly accurate predictions. In searching for the best predictive models, we experiment with eight different machine learning algorithms and 60 predictor variables that characterize the social environment, the physical environment, and the aspects and degrees of neighborhood disorder. Our analysis suggests that (a) the sociodemographic and socioeconomic variables are the strongest predictors for tract-level health outcomes and (b) the historical records of 311 service requests can be a useful complementary data source as the information distilled from the 311 data often helps improve the models' performance. The machine learning models yielded from this study can help the public and city officials evaluate future scenarios and understand how changes in the neighborhood conditions can lead to changes in the health outcomes.

The effect of UHI can be described quantitatively by urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI). For measuring urban health and ensuring sustainable development, the analysis of LST and UTFVI are receiving boosted attention. This study predicted LULC, seasonal (summer & winter) LST, and UTFVI variations using machine learning algorithms (MLAs) in Cumilla City Corporation (CCC), Bangladesh. Landsat 4–5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI satellite images were used for 1999, 2009, and 2019 to predict future scenarios for 2029 and 2039. MLAs such as Cellular Automata (CA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods were used to predict the future change in LULC, LST, and UTFVI. The result suggests that, in the year 2029 and 2039, the urban area will likely to be increased by around 8 % and 11 %, where significant decrease will be taken place in green cover by 9 % and 14 %. If the rapid urban growth continues, more than 30 % of the CCC area will likely to be experienced more than 33 °C temperature and strongest UTFVI effect in the year 2029 and 2039. In addition, an average 4 °C higher LST was recorded in the urban area compared with vegetation cover. In urban construction practice, avoiding concentrated impermeable layers (built-up areas) and increasing green covers, are effective ways of mitigating the effect of UTFVI.

However, the issue of bias in these data and the fairness of outcomes in smart cities has received relatively limited attention. This is a troubling and significant omission, as social equity should be a critical aspect of smart cities and needs to be addressed and accounted for in the use of new technologies and data tools. This paper examines bias in resident-reported data by analyzing socio-spatial disparities in ‘311’ complaint behavior in Kansas City, Missouri. We utilize data from detailed 311 reports and a comprehensive resident satisfaction survey, and spatially join these data with code enforcement violations, neighborhood characteristics, and street condition assessments. We introduce a model to identify disparities in resident-government interactions and classify under- and over-reporting neighborhoods based on complaint behavior. Despite greater objective and subjective need, low-income and minority neighborhoods are less likely to report street condition or “nuisance” issues, while prioritizing more serious problems. Our findings form the basis for acknowledging and accounting for data bias in self-reported data, and contribute to the more equitable delivery of city services through bias-aware data-driven processes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under award No. 1926470 and by a grant from the John D. and Catherine T.

The objectives of this study were to: (i) investigate the changes of the Land Cover (LC) and Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) in Yerevan and analyze relations between them, (ii) study the relationships between land surface temperature (LST) and environmental factors/parameters, (iii) explore the accuracy of satellite derived LST. LC and SUHI were derived from Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI-TIRS images (years 1989, 2000, 2010 and 2018) by means of three Machine Learning algorithms and the Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI) ecological evaluation index, respectively. The comparison between Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and satellite LSTs showed that the overall spatial pattern of Landsat and UAV LSTs matched. It was found that the green and built-up areas were the main factors affecting LST variation in Yerevan. The results of the LC change analysis revealed an expansion of built-up areas and the reduction of green spaces. Yerevan shares almost an equal percentage of land for the excellent and the worst categories of the UTFVI. The transformations from excellent to the worst category of UTFVI were mainly related to the loss of green spaces, while the opposite transformations were associated with the gain of vegetation cover, the construction of new districts and the reduction/cessation of anthropogenic heat emission. It appeared that the urban construction had possibly led to the improvement of UTFVI index in the case of no/low anthropogenic heat emission. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",This study was supported by the RA MESCS State Committee of Science [grant number 18T-1E085 ]; EU HORIZON2020 Framework Program Connecting Nature Project [grant number: 730222 ].,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85093926656,Yes,Armenia,Urban Climate,Environment & Sustainability,Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability,Remote Sensing,Analysis,"Study spatial-temporal changes of land cover and surface urban heat island in Yerevan, Armenia","SDG 11, SDG 13",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Strong

Street view images (SVIs) have shown great potential for automated land-use classification for land-use mapping. However, previous studies overlooked SVI-derived location contextual information that may help improve land-use classification. This study proposes a novel land-use classification method that synthesizes location semantics from SVIs to account for contextual information from SVIs, land parcels and roads around the SVIs. The proposed method first generates land-use scene images (LUSIs) by using an SVI-derived straightforward algorithm. The LUSIs are then relocated to land parcels by using a displacement strategy and classified into land-use types by using a deep learning network. This study determines the land-use types of land parcels with classified LUSIs. Two case studies, consisting of LUSIs for five land-use types, show that introducing location semantics of SVIs can remarkably improve the classification accuracy of land-use types. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","This research was supported by the National Earth Observation Data Center [NODAOP2020015], the National Natural Science Foundation of China [41801378, 42071382] and the Open Fund of Key Laboratory of Urban Land Resources Monitoring and Simulation, Ministry of Natural Resources [KF-2019-04-033].

With the rise of Internet of Things devices, there are now data sets available that can be used to provide smart, sustainable transport solutions within cities. In this work, we introduce long short-term memory networks for the prediction of congestion propagation across a road network. Based on vehicle speed data from traffic sensors at two sites, our model predicts the propagation of congestion across a 5-min period within a busy town. Analysis of both univariate and multivariate predictive models show an accuracy of 84–95% depending on the road layout. This accuracy shows that long short-term memory networks are suitable for predicting congestion propagation on road networks and may form a key component of future traffic modelling approaches for smart and sustainable cities around the world. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092437788,Yes,United Kingdom,Transportation,Transportation & Mobility,Urban Mobility & Transportation,"Machine Learning, IoT",Prediction/Forecasting,Develop congestion prediction for smart sustainable cities using IoT and machine learning,"SDG 11, SDG 13",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Future,Cross-sectional,Strong

The significance of smart cities lies in not having technology itself but using technology with a novel approach to solve urban problems, enhance the quality of life for urban residents, and optimize government performance. Such an approach includes scientifically processing civic query (including complaints, suggestions, and inquiry) data about a city and planning the city such that its policies reflect its residents' voices to ensure “throughput legitimacy.” This study introduces a novel approach to analyze diverse informal civic query data for a city and plan the city in a way that its residents want.

The current policy framework to ensure the quality of life of inhabitants leaving no one behind, leads decision-makers to seek better-informed choices for the sustainable planning of urban areas. Thus, a better understanding between the spatial structure of cities and their socio-economic level is of crucial relevance. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to quantify this two-way relationship. Therefore, we measured spatial patterns of 31 cities in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. We rely on spatial pattern metrics derived from a Local Climate Zone classification obtained by fusing remote sensing and open GIS data with a machine learning approach. Based upon the data, we quantified the relationship between spatial pattern metrics and socio-economic variables related to ‘education’, ‘health’, ‘living conditions’, ‘labor’, and ‘transport’ by means of multiple linear regression models, explaining the variability of the socio-economic variables from 43% up to 82%. Additionally, we grouped cities according to their level of ‘quality of life’ using the socio-economic variables, and found that the spatial pattern of low-dense built-up types was different among socio-economic groups. The proposed methodology described in this paper is transferable to other datasets, levels, and regions. This is of great potential, due to the growing availability of open statistical and satellite data and derived products.

The aim of this research was to quantify the effects of land-use/land-cover (LU/LC) changes on urban land surface temperature (LST) during a 25-year period (1993–2018) for the semiarid Shiraz City in southern Iran using Landsat data (TM, ETM+, and OLI/TIRS) and machine learning algorithms. Five main LU/LC classes, such as orchard, vegetation, bare surface, asphalt cover, and built-up areas, were identified using a support vector machine algorithm. Landsat images were used to retrieve normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI). The results showed that the mean LST over the entire study domain increased considerably between 1993 and 2018, due to urbanization, decrease of green areas, and increasing industrial areas. Built-up areas increased considerably by 25.8% from 80 to 100.6 km2 between 1993 and 2018, while vegetation cover decreased dramatically by 69.3%. Mean LST increased from 38.4 to 40.2°C during the 25-year period with a significant increase of 3.9°C between 2013 and 2018.

The key to achieving this advantage is effective data transmission. Correspondingly, by exploiting these recorded massive traffic data, a variety of AI-assisted data transmission methods are designed to improve the data transmission performance in the vehicular network environment (VNE) to ensure the effective operation of ITS. To help readers get an initial understanding of how AI technology can help with data transmission in VNE, in this letter, we will discuss two types of AI-assisting methods targeting the data dissemination performance enhancement in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications respectively in detail, that is, predictive handover/pre-caching algorithm and predicted traffic flow-assisted data routing protocols.

To accurately solve the problem, several algorithms have been proposed in this paper. These can be split into two categories. First, algorithms based on data mining and knowledge discovery, which study the different correlation among human behavioral data, and identify the collective abnormal human behavior from knowledge extracted. Secondly, algorithms exploring convolution deep neural networks, which learn different features of historical data to determine the collective abnormal human behaviors. Experiments on an actual human behaviors database have been carried out to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed algorithms. The results show that the deep learning solution outperforms both data mining as well as the state-of-the-art solutions in terms of runtime and accuracy performance. In particular, for large datasets, the accuracy of the deep learning solution reaches 88%, however other solutions do not exceed 81%. Additionally, the runtime of the deep learning solution is below 50 seconds, whereas other solutions need more than 80 seconds for analyzing the same database. © 2020 The Authors",This research was partially funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Grant program ( RGPIN-2020-05363 ) held by Dr. Gautam Srivastava.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089426749,Yes,Norway,Security/Surveillance,Security & Safety,Urban Resilience & Safety,"Deep Learning, CNN",Detection,Develop deep learning model for pedestrian collective behavior analysis and trajectory outlier detection,"SDG 11, SDG 16",Empirical,Quantitative,Local,Past,Longitudinal,Strong

Most cities and urban regions all over the world compete to increase resident and visitor satisfaction. The growing requirements and rapidity of introducing new technologies to all aspects of residents’ lives force cities and urban regions to implement “smart cities” concepts in their activities. Real estate is one of the principal anthropogenic components of urban environment thus become a subject of thorough multidisciplinary analysis in the field of data requiring spatial information systems. Recent advances in information technology, combined with the increased availability of high-resolution imagery from Earth observation, create an opportunity to use new sources of data that enable to identify, monitor, and solved many of urban environmental problem. The aim of the paper is to elaborate precise, complete and detailed property information with the use of remote sensing observations in a suitable numerical algorithm. The authors concentrate on providing one of the most important, and probably the most lacking, feature describing properties – building usable floor area (BUFA). The solution is elaborated in the form of an automatic algorithm based on machine learning and computer vision technology related to LiDAR (big data), close range images with respect to spatial information systems requirements. The obtained results related to BUFA estimation in comparison to the state-of-the-art results are satisfactory and may increase the reliability of decision-making in investment, fiscal, registration and planning aspects. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Funding text 1: This work was supported by the National Science Centre [grant number 2019/33/B/HS4/00072 ]; and the "" Development Program of the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn "", Task 16.

While the video surveillance system is a crucial part of the integrated pipe gallery, which provides a basis for the construction of smart city. Due to the large amount of video data, manual monitoring is a time-consuming and laborious task. To address the above problems, we propose a neural network-based method that incorporates the concept of area under curve (AUC) with the multiple-instance learning (MIL) approach. We formulate the multiple-instance AUC (MIAUC) model that predicts high anomaly scores for anomalous segments. Furthermore, sparsity and temporal smoothness constraints are utilized in the loss function to better detect anomaly. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, a new database is established based on the video surveillance system, which consists of 110 real-world surveillance videos with a total length of 24 h. The experimental results on the real-world database show that our method achieves better performance as compared to the baselines methods.

First, we advance a theoretical framework to understand the diffusion of autonomous cars in cities, on the basis of three interconnected factors: social attitudes, technological innovation and urban politics. Second, we draw upon an in-depth survey conducted in Dublin (1,233 respondents), to provide empirical evidence of (a) the public interest in autonomous cars and the intention to use them once available, (b) the fears and concerns that individuals have regarding autonomous vehicles and (c) how people intend to employ this new form of transport. Third, we use the empirics generated via the survey as a stepping stone to discuss possible urban futures, focusing on the changes in urban design and sustainability that the transition to autonomous transport is likely to trigger.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence and the availability of remote sensing data have opened up opportunities for bottom-up modeling techniques that allow understanding of how subtle differences in the urban fabric can impact transportation mode share distribution. This project presents a novel neural network-based modeling technique capable of predicting transportation mode distribution. Trained with millions of images labeled with information from a georeferenced transportation survey, the resulting model is able to infer transportation mode share with high accuracy (R2 = 0.58) from satellite images alone. Additionally, this method can disaggregate data in areas where only aggregated information is available and infer transportation mode share in areas without underlying information. This work demonstrates a new and objective method to evaluate the impact of the urban fabric on transportation mode share. The methodology is robust and can be adapted for cases around the world as well as deployed to evaluate the impact of new developments on the transportation mode choice. © The Author(s) 2019.","This project was made possible thanks to accessible hardware of the THUD (Transportation Health and Urban Design) Research Hub at the University of Melbourne.

Detection methods of land use distribution have to keep pace with their rapidly changing landscapes. While traditional analysis relies on surveys and census data typically refreshed at most yearly, the widespread use of mobile devices allows cell phone activity measurements to be used as sensors for the functional clustering of urban districts. These activity-based proprietary measurements are recently complemented by publicly available geosocial network records that even enable content-aware analysis. As a bridge between separate methods, in this work we analyze the relation of conversation content and functional spatial clusters of cities using a double dataset approach. We look at the differentiating power of the content of local conversations in activity-driven land use detection based on mobile phone records. In addition to intra-city analysis of three metropolises, we present a comparative study of London, New York City, and Los Angeles sharing the common language of English, but having very different cultural backgrounds. We show that the share of words with a similar temporal pattern to that of local mobile activities is different across cities, as well as between functional clusters. We find that the conversational content can effectively differentiate both functional clusters of a single city, and similar locations of the same function across many cities, like business areas that otherwise have a common temporal heartbeat. Moreover, we identify words related to activity types as the most important features emerging from the content-based, data-driven classification. © The Author(s) 2019.",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065652442,Yes,Hungary,Land Use/Zoning,Urban Planning & Land Use,Urban Development & Land Use,"Machine Learning, Content Analysis",Detection,Detect evolving urban structures using content-aware social monitoring,SDG 11,Empirical,Mixed,Local,Present,Cross-sectional,Medium

In urban studies, these technologies have been instrumental in the development of smart cities and autonomous vehicles. However, a knowledge gap is present when it comes to informal urban regions in less developed countries. How can deep learning and artificial intelligence untangle the complexities of informality to advance urban modelling? In this paper, we introduce a framework for multipurpose realistic-dynamic urban modelling using deep convolutional neural networks. The purpose of the framework is twofold: (1) to sense and detect informality and slums in urban scenes from aerial and street-level images and (2) to detect pedestrian and transport modes. The model has been trained on images of urban scenes in cities across the globe. The framework shows strong validation performance in the identification of planned and unplanned regions, despite broad variations in the classified images. The algorithms of the URBAN-i model are coded in Python and the trained models can be applied to images of any urban setting, including informal settlements and slum regions. © The Author(s) 2019.","We would like to thank Prof. Michael Batty for his feedback and discussion towards improving this article.

The stream of the data generated by sensor networks contains the information which can be used to model and manage the behavior of these infrastructures. With the expansion of the scale of the sensor networks, machine learning algorithms are increasingly used for detection of anomalies in these networks. Detection of the anomalies in industrial control network should be performed in real time. An important issue in computer and industrial sensor networks is the problem of latency and jitter. In this paper, a metaheuristic algorithm for optimal detection of the unusual behaviors and anomalies in the industrial sensor networks in presence of latency and jitter is proposed. The proposed algorithm uses the recently proposed optimizers and a neural network for modeling the behavior of the sensor network. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of recognizing the anomalies in the industrial sensor networks with high accuracy. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",This work is a part of research performed in Khatam Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.

Soils were assessed to provide a baseline chemistry for site owners, developers, occupiers and regulators involved in understanding the potential risk to human health and the environment. TOC range was 1.75-11.85 % (mean 5.82 %), BC 3.72-32.71 mg.g-1 (mean 13.8 mg.g-1), TPH 72-4673 mg.g-1 (mean 443 mg.g-1), Σ16PAH 1.64-421.23 mg.g-1 (mean 47.99 mg.g-1) and Σ7PCB 2.56-148.72 µg.kg-1 (mean 20.82 µg.kg-1). Surface soils were less polluted than sub-surface soils due to a decline in industry, power generation, coal burning and traffic. PAH and PCB showed a stronger affinity for BC than TOC and were higher than many other international cities. South east London (Greenwich, Woolwich, Deptford) had the highest PAH pollution. Source PAH ratios confirmed a combustion/urban road run-off origin with minor petroleum inputs. Random Forest spatial modelling (machine learning) revealed large scale pollution trends across London soils.

The relationship between flood disasters and influencing factors is a complex, multi-variable, non-linear relationship, which is closely related to the geology, land-form , land cover and many other factors of the study area. For different research areas, collecting as comprehensive as possible influencing factors and optimizing them are the prerequisite and guarantee for realizing accurate assessment of flood susceptibility. Anyi County, Nanchang City is located in the middle and lower reaches of the Liaohe River and is the main area affected by flood disasters. Based on remote sensing image data and geographic information system technology, this article takes Anyi County, Nanchang City as an example to carry out the influencing factors analysis and susceptibility assessment of storm and flood. First, Sentinel-1 radar images before and after the disaster were used to extract the inundation range of storm and flood in Anyi County from June 30 to July 5, 2016, and 15 influencing factors of flood susceptibility were selected such as elevation, precipitation, land use, distance from the rivers and slope, etc. Then, based on the random forest, the importance of influencing factors was obtained , and the unimportant influencing factors were gradually reduced according to the ranking results of the importance, and the influencing factors were optimized and selected based on the neural network model. Finally, based on the optimized influencing factors, the neural network model was used to evaluate the flood susceptibility of Anyi County, and an example was used to verify the reliability of the flood susceptibility assessment results. The research results show that after reducing the five least important influencing factors of convergence index, aspect, profile curvature, topographical position index and stream power index, the performance of the neural network model has been improved to a certain extent; Areas with moderate or higher flood susceptibility levels are mainly distributed on both banks of the Liaohe River, occupying approximately one third Anyi County, and nearly 70% of the floods are distributed in areas with moderate or higher flood susceptibility levels, the possibility of floods occurring in areas with flood susceptibility levels of medium or above is very high, and the result of flood susceptibility assessment is consistent with the actual situation in Anyi County. © 2021 Shaanxi Earthquake Agency.
